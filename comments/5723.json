For instance hover events still work in this area but the cursor will change back to default. \n\nThere are some different ways to remove/hide this title bar and maybe someone else has some pointers on which is the best route?\n"

    "body": "@kevinsawicki @jlord This can be fixed by getting rid of the title bar (and `NSToolbar` for `hidden-inset`) entirely and manually adding the standard window buttons to the window. In our Electron app, we use `frame: false` and pass `BrowserWindow.getNativeWindowHandle()` to a native module to do exactly that.\r\n\r\nTo make the button icons appear on hover, we would have to use the undocumented `_mouseInGroup` NSView method. This is also used by [Chromium](https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/chrome/browser/ui/cocoa/tabs/tab_strip_controller.mm?q=_mouseInGroup&sq=package:chromium&l=197) so it should be pretty safe. If you're fine OK with this, I'm happy to contribute a patch when I have some time.\r\n\r\nAs side-benefit...\r\n\r\n* we could allow arbitrary positioning of the window buttons (instead of just two distinct positions with `hidden` and `hidden-inset`)\r\n* we would fix the `hidden-inset` drag and drop issue (#7942)\r\n\r\n#6725 is not relevant for our app so I haven't looked into it."
