    "body": "Well, it is important to emphasise that I am not using `electron-packager`. I had a python \"build script\" (same script runs in windows, linux and os x) that would build other stuff independent to my electron app, then if running on mac it would copy everything into the general OS X app bundle directories, and finally zip everything into a single file.\n\nSo, in my specific case there were two issues with my script, I was copying the electron files without respecting symlinks (very easy to fix), and then the `zipfile` module in Python was not respecting the symlinks either, which was not as easy as I expected. If you google solutions to the problem you'll find a few articles with odd implementations that were closer to magic than a real explanation, so after some time unsuccessfully trying to get it to work I ended up just running a subprocess that executes the os x `zip` CLI command with the required flags for respecting symlinks.\n"

Unfortunately since everything is patched in order to work it isn't as easy as making it use standalone versions of each to cut down on the size. I am sure the Electron team would like a smaller size. But you just can't plan and make it happen. It is just too caustic on the overall project to go in thinking you can remove even 10-20 megs of code and resources and expect everything to run stable.\n"

One thing though has helped me out here: I was putting modules like electron-prebuilt, electron-builder and electron-packager and all their dependencies in the \"app\" folder.

    "body": "@leonelcbraz Feel free to borrow or get ideas from my ignore regex for `electron-packager`. I create executable files in the bin directory, have a src directory for unminified source files, use Grunt for building, and have other stuff I didn't need in there. If I work on a project I don't need to use the node context I just set `nodeIntegration` to `false` and ignore the whole node_modules directory. This drastically reduced my distribution size.\n\n`(^(/bin|/src)$|[Gg]runt(.*)|node_modules/grunt-(.*)|node_modules/electron-(.*))`\n\nAdditionally there is no need to use use the two-package.json structure. NPM supports developer dependencies. You can install one via `npm install <package name> --save-dev`. You will then notice in your package.json you have a `dependencies` and `devDependencies` with your dependencies separated neatly. Modifying the ignore regex for `electron-packager` like I did above you can completely isolate them from your app yet work in a normal node.js environment.\n"

As a result this trick might not work to your expectations. You can downgrade NPM to version 2 using `npm i npm@2 -g` though.\r\n\r\nIn the future our solution for our project at work is using NPM3 but putting everything we don't want shipped as a dev dependency. We install our Electron build tools globally opposed to the project level. Then doing an install of only needed modules with `npm install --only=production`. This however isn't ideal for open source projects but it works for our office. It is unfortunate we have to have a weird setup like this but it is doubtful NPM will ever be designed with Electron in mind since it is just a blip in the NPM ecosystem."
