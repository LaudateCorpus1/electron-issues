    "body": "> Electron (or rather the end-user app: Atom, Brave, etc.) ask a non-admin user several times (over the period of a week, sorry: didn't understand the correct rhythm) to install a helper and for that it requests \"admin privileges\".\r\n\r\nThis is Squirrel.Mac not being able to update because permissions are too restrictive, we're seeing this at Slack too. The bug is that letting it have Administrator doesn't solve the issue - the app doesn't update and the user keeps getting the Helper dialog. /cc @joshaber "
