    "body": "@kevinsawicki I think I've identified the issue. Well sort of. I tried copying the main.js of my application over to an electron-quick-start project and it ran fine. So the only difference would be the index.html content that it was loading. I started stripping out content line by line and found that it was my main application bundle that was blocking the event. Unfortunately, my app is in a giant browserified bundle so I can't tell where the problem is. Also it doesn't throw any errors and using `dom-ready` instead works fine. I don't know what triggers `ready-to-show` but it seems to be stuck somewhere when parsing javascript.\r\n\r\nAlso, if `ready-to-show` doesn't fire, this seems to also affect the window close events, as in `close` and `closed` will never fire either."

    "body": "Also hit this issue. \r\n\r\nIt turns out that when Electron was maximized, and it'd restart, maximized, the the window would show, but this event would never fire. Despite having my windows set visibility to false, I'm assuming it doesn't fire because of this: https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/fcc7dc774accfeb526d7ec8b7ff7115c0693f416/atom/browser/native_window.cc#L565 - which may be a mistake, it should probably always fire regardless of the window being visible or not??\r\n\r\nIf it matters, I'm also using https://github.com/mawie81/electron-window-state which may be triggering something to cause this issue."
