    "body": "Okay, I've figured this out on Windows. The issue is that the window does not have the correct styles applied to it.\n\nHere is a Stack Overflow answer which provides some detail about how to get the animation for a frameless window.\n\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/a/17713810/170217\n\n> The simplest window style I got the shadow to work with was WS_POPUP | WS_THICKFRAME, to also get aero snap, maximizing, minimizing, and the smooth minimize animation I used WS_POPUP | WS_THICKFRAME | WS_MINIMIZEBOX | WS_MAXIMIZEBOX | WS_CAPTION.\n\nHere is the code I used to solve this:\n\natom\\browser\\native_window_views.cc\n\n``` cpp\nNativeWindowViews::NativeWindowViews(content::WebContents* web_contents,\n                                     const mate::Dictionary& options)\n    : NativeWindow(web_contents, options),\n      window_(new views::Widget),\n      web_view_(inspectable_web_contents()->GetView()->GetView()),\n      menu_bar_autohide_(false),\n      menu_bar_visible_(false),\n      menu_bar_alt_pressed_(false),\n      keyboard_event_handler_(new views::UnhandledKeyboardEventHandler),\n      use_content_size_(false),\n      resizable_(true) {\n\n// CODE OMITTED...\n\n  if (has_frame_ &&\n      options.Get(switches::kUseContentSize, &use_content_size_) &&\n      use_content_size_) {\n    bounds = ContentBoundsToWindowBounds(bounds);\n  }\n\n#if defined(OS_WIN)\n  if (!has_frame_) {\n    // set Window style so that we get a minimize and maximize animation when frameless\n    DWORD frame_style = WS_THICKFRAME | WS_MINIMIZEBOX | WS_MAXIMIZEBOX | WS_CAPTION;\n    ::SetWindowLong(GetAcceleratedWidget(), GWL_STYLE, frame_style);\n  }\n#endif\n\n  window_->UpdateWindowIcon();\n  window_->CenterWindow(bounds.size());\n  Layout();\n}\n```\n\nApparently you need all those styles to make animation work on minimize and maximize. I was able to eliminate the WS_POPUP as the SO answer suggested.\n\nI'll submit a pull request.\n"
