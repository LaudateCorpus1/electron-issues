    "body": "> I am now trying to achieve the same on electron. My system should run local and the Auth from oAuth. I came across this Here. I thought i can use it but i am not sure if i can listen to the load or any event on this property. Please is there any way i can attach an event of the shell the same way i did with the cordova plugin above ? \n\nMost people do oAuth inside Electron by opening a new `BrowserWindow` with the oAuth URL.  This gives you event access like you have in your cordova example.\n\n> My code breaks and throw error from the ./node_modules/electron/index.js\n\nTo use `electron` with WebPack you have to define certain things as globals, I'm not familiar with the WebPack build system but a quick issue / google search should reveal the config you need.\n\nIn the future please ask questions like this on the discussion forums or Slack.  The github issues section is primarily for bugs üëç \n"
