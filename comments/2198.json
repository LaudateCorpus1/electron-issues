    "body": "@shrewdlogarithm The issue you are having with the .asar archive is due the monkey-patched version of the `fs` module - it has been modified in order to support .asar archives however there is a side-effect that other modules which use `fs` will fail if they manipulate .asar archives (ie rimraf on a folder with an asar in it, unzipping zip with an asar in it, etc etc). In order to be able to manipulate .asar files, you need to be sure the modules using `fs` require `original-fs` instead. You can attempt to globally monkey patch `fs` back to original state before using your `fs` modules. This is a known issue marked as `wontfix`.\n\nSee:\nhttps://github.com/atom/electron/issues/2035\nhttps://github.com/atom/electron/issues/782\nhttps://github.com/atom/electron/issues/1658\n\nWe are implementing a similar strategy to update our application (downloading and replacing an asar), feel free to contact me if you'd like to discuss.\n"
