    "body": "I think rendering is done properly at 20 FPS in your case, those bigger values come from the fact that the rendering itself in chrome is halted for a little (that's why there is bigger values in the beginning, because it still loads the page) and no new changes happen (setting a frame rate means setting the maximum rate of the rendering), if there is no change in the frame, no `paint` event will be emitted.\n\nIn your case to prevent these long pauses, I can suggest to try to use the new `webContents.invalidate()` (will be available next electron version) to generate a new paint event on-demand, when you exceed a certain time limit.\n"
