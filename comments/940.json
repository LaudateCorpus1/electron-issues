For example, if my general app has a zoom factor of 2, my webview's html and body will have a width 'W' px and height 'H' px where 'W' and 'H' are half of the value of the containing element. If zoom is 1.5, 'W' and 'H' will be 2/3rds of the containing element. Weird, might be a chromium thing.\n\nI'm fairly certain this is not a CSS/HTML issue as I've explored this problem on my app for over a month at varying levels of the webview and renderer levels\n"
