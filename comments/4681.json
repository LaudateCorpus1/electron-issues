The weird thing is I don't know why Electron crashes if notification failed, but not if the notification succeeds. Because from windows_toast_notification.cc, it looks like `WindowsToastNotification::NotificationDismissed()` and `WindowsToastNotification::NotificationFailed()` are doing almost the same thing: remove itself from presenter\n\nAnyway I don't much enough about chromium's weak_ptr implementation, so would appreciate if you can provide some help!\n"

I haven't found good documentation on [MSDN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.ui.notifications.toastnotification.failed.aspx)\n\nI'm attaching the callstack (this callstack is not reproducible every time because most of the time the failure handler is not called synchronously, but when this indeed happens the app crashes, there's a one to one strong correlation)..\n\n![callstack](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/203771/13613966/21551ba6-e523-11e5-8888-7d5f4a29d11c.png)\n"
