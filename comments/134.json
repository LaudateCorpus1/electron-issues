I found the following documentation on session `webRequest` https://github.com/atom/electron/blob/master/docs/api/session.md#seswebrequest but implementing it has proven challenging.\n\nI'm trying to do this in the context of the `electron-har` project https://github.com/shyiko/electron-har/issues/7 where Electron is run headlessly utilizing chromium's devtools to generate a HAR document.\n\nAdditionally, if there are any docs around utilizing the existing dev tools device user agent profiles per the mobile emulation system, I would appreciate any help in either regard.\n"
