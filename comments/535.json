I'm not familiar with the internals of Atom and Chromium, but it would seem that there are already some mechanisms in place for generating BrowserWindow events in response to events in the client document: for example, the 'page-title-updated' event fires with the clients document.title changes.\n\nThanks for taking the time to respond to my bug reports :)\n"
