    "body": "Just think of another thing: perhaps what I need is not the asynchronous version of toPng(). In fact, I will make video from pictures using  FFmpeg, and all video format will do the encoding, so encoding of the capture buffer is unnecessary for me.\n\nI don't know the format got from capturePage() callback, guess it would be different according the OS. Whatever it is, only if it can be handled by FFmpeg, it's enough for my use case.\n\nSo my request is a new method just get raw buffer, with no compression, such as toRaw().\n\nThanks!\n"
