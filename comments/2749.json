    "body": "Hey folks (@zcbenz @felixrieseberg et al) - its not clear if the events based control of webview creation still continues to require that the parent BrowserWindow have nodeintegration enabled.\n1. There are many requests/issues asking for enabling webview when parent BrowserWindow nodeintegration is turned off. Is there an architectural/design issue with enabling webview when parent BrowserWindow has disabled nodeintegration?\n2. Many apps built on Electron render third party content, and/or user generated content. The proposed alternative (for my issue #6157) is enabling nodeintegration on the BrowserWindow and disabling node symbols in BW preload -  is there some discussion/doc on how secure this approach is? would enabling nodeintegration on BW and just removing the node symbols in preload make the BW process behavior identical to when BW has nodeintegration turned off?\n\nThanks much in advance folks.\n"

I think there is many people requiring the same, and everyone is doing workarounds in order to have this.   Why is not possible to reenable Webviews while nodeintegration is off?  If it is because  the Preload danger, that can be overcome with protocol filters (not letting people load JS files from the network for example), or the proposed will-create-webview and striping the Preload.\n\nThanks,\nChris\n"
