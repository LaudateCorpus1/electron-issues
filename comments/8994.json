    "body": "Solved my problem for back and forward shortcuts by simply mapping the menu items to the accelerators `CmdOrCtrl+Left` and `CmdOrCtrl+Right` (for macOS. `Alt` instead of `CmdOrCtrl` for Windows/Linux). \r\n\r\n`CmdOrCtrl+Ã¼` and `CmdOrCtrl+Plus` anyways had the problem that they are not very intuitive & `CmdOrCtrl+Plus` is normally mapped to \"Zoom in\"."
