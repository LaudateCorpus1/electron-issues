It's not about the app not being able to run from outside `/Applications`, I don't think any OS X app has that limitation. Users are free to run their apps from anywhere. This is just about being friendly and ask once to move the app to the `/Applications` folder as that's what 99% of users would want. Nice UX like this goes a long way.

    "body": "I have implemented a sudo for Mac without any native dependencies using a bit of a hack:\n1. First try and run the command using sudo in non-interactive mode (with the -n switch). If it succeeds then the command ran and nothing further is required. If the command fails because privileges are required and the sudo timestamp for the user has expired then \"sudo: a password is required\" will be written to stderr, and privileges need to be requested.\n2. Use \"which\" to lookup the location of the AppleScript binary (osascript) and copy this to a tmp path, but using the name of your application as the name of the copied binary. This causes the OS X permissions prompt to show the name of your application instead of the AppleScript binary.\n3. Use the new AppleScript binary to set the sudo timestamp for your user:\n\n```\nvar command = '\"' + tmposascript + '\" -e \\'do shell script \"mkdir -p /var/db/sudo/$USER; touch /var/db/sudo/$USER\" with administrator privileges\\'';\n```\n\nThis command will cause OS X to show a UI to the user asking for their password.\n\nFinally, re-run the command that required privileges.\n\nLike this, your app will only request permissions when necessary, and not on every invocation of a command which requires privileges, i.e. only when your sudo timestamp runs out.\n\nPerhaps, it would be a good idea to include this kind of functionality into Electron (probably using the proper OS X apis for it), as a core building block for more complex features.\n"

    "body": "@jorangreef That sounds like a good alternative (and would make a good NPM package). The only issue that I can see is that it will be 'osascript' requesting the privileges instead of {{ myAppName }} and it will also have the Applescript logo instead of my app's logo. This isn't a huge deal but for people who don't know what osascript is then it may raise alarm bells.\n\nWhat about if you saved the Applescript as an app (with your apps logo and name) and packaged it inside of your app? Then you could `exec` the app and it would carry your app's name and logo, so it wouldn't look out of place.\n"
