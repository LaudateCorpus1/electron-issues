I did the simplest possible `debugger` test in electron-quick-start and the app still did not pause on the debugger:\nhttps://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start/compare/master...jefffriesen:debugger\n1. Updated to Electron 1.4.1\n2. Put a debugger in renderer.js:\n\n``` js\nconsole.log('before debugger')\ndebugger\nconsole.log('after debugger')\n```\n\nExecution is never paused and both console.log's fire.\n\nSo either this isn't fixed in 1.4.1 or maybe devtools needs to be configured differently? Or something else?\n\nI'm trying to fix this https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate/issues/379\n\nAny help would be awesome. Thanks\n"
