    "body": "GitHub issues are for feature requests and bug reports, questions about using Electron should be directed to the [community](https://github.com/electron/electron#community) or to the [Slack Channel](http://atom-slack.herokuapp.com/).\r\n\r\nFWIW what you are trying to do simply isn't possible the way you are trying to do it, passing functions as a string removes all context from that function so \"var\" will not be accessible when that function is recreated as a string in the renderer process.  You need to use IPC to send the click event back to the main process"
