The `open-url` event may be emitted very early, even before the `will-finish-launching` event, this situation happens when Atom is started to open the URL. And we should also be careful not to open the empty editor in this case.\n2. The `open-url` event can be emitted for multiple times after application finished launching, just like `open-file`.\n3. OS X reads the `Info.plist` to register the URL scheme, so `atom://` can work only after you opened the `Atom.app` for once.\n"
