    "body": "Okey let's describe more in details. Electron exposes functions to the renderer process which do several electron app actions. Managing windows/dialogs or print - those are the one I found. However if you use Electron as a crawler and open arbitary pages and js code. All these functions I listed (and maybe more) should be prevented to use entitely. The resize methods even work on the main browser window.\r\nOr another one I remember (list is at home): window.abort()\r\nor speechSynthese - this one can be disabled by a chromium flag.\r\n\r\nTo go a step further, I also think about disable any \"scrolling\" by window methods or anchor clicking.\r\n\r\nHow you can disable a navigation by form submit, I don't figure it out - all other page navigations can be canceled on electron side.\r\n\r\nI want to discuss how you can control the browser as much as possible to prevent any not intended actions caused by the arbitary code.\r\n\r\nAnother step I tried to face is how even improve the page loading by skipping unneccesary things.\r\n\r\nSo I got the ad-blocker work in electron.\r\n\r\nOther ideas were:\r\n- setTimeout/setInterval mods if it not corrupt anything\r\n- instant finish/speed up animations\r\n\r\nSo at the end of the day with all this tweaks the goal is to get a **secure** and **optimized** web crawler which is less expensive.\r\n"
