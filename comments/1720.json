    "body": "I am also having this issue. If there is anything you need to help debug this issue, let me know.\n\nHow I currently reproduce it:\n1. I load up my electron app for the first time which requests images from an embedded web server.\n2. I close my electron app.\n3. I alter the image assets.\n4. I open the electron app again and observe that the images shown are always the images that were loaded on the first load of the app.\n\nThe browser is actually making a request for each image and the web server is responding to the request for each image and sending the image to the browser but the image displayed never changes.\n\nLike the original poster I am using cachebuster urls and the `--disable-http-cache` switch.\n"
