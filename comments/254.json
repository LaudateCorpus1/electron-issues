If I install jQuery locally via NPM and load a local html file then using:\n\nmainWindow.$ = require('jQuery');\nmainWindow.jQuery = require('jQuery');\n\nthen it works as expected.  If, however, I do mainWindow.loadUrl('http://external.site.com\");\n\nI get the errors mentioned where $ and jQuery are not defined.  Disabling node integration is really not an acceptable answer; it's the reason I'm using Electron in the first place, I need it.  \n\nI'd be keen to get into the source and troubleshoot this myself but thought I would see if anyone had any additional information on this to point me in the right direction before I go down there.  Has anyone been able to get this to work _with_ node integration, against external sites?\n\nThanks... and great work BTW.  Everything new and beautiful, like this, is going to start with a few wrinkles.\n\nKind Regards\n\n/W\n"

    "body": "Hi dilmdeep, thanks for the quick response.  Does your solution depend on having control over the external site?  I'm trying to load a site that I don't have source access to.  What you said about packages.json is interesting though.  I did install jQuery through npm (and used the documented rebuild for electron) and, like I said, I can use jQuery with a local HTML file, but jQuery is not defined in my package.json.....  Oh and I tested with disabling node-integration and while that does work, it's not what I need.  Thanks.\n"

    "body": "I just wanted to update this in case someone else gets into the same trouble.  The way I worked around this (after downloading 10GB of Electron source) was actually in the documentation to begin with.  Instead of calling the url of the external site I loaded a local HTML file and used a webview from that html file to load the external site.  It loads perfectly with node-integration enabled.  Just look in the docs for webview, it's pretty straight forward.  Also my thanks to Paul in the chatroom for helping me get started with the source.  If anyone's wondering they use Atom (of course) to code Electron, WinDbg on windows to debug and Ninja to compile.  FYI compiling the sources was dead easy and surprisingly fast, it compiled first go using their scripts and the provided documentation.  Again, great work guys!\n"

Enabling nodeintegration on the webview isn't an option since this will break jQuery that is being used by the external url. \n\nWhat we ended up doing was adding a preload script to the webview where we put the modules we need in the global scope. This makes them accessible later on when we execute our Javascript.\n\npreload.js:\n\n```\nglobal.ipcRenderer = require('electron').ipcRenderer;\n```\n\nAnd then we can access the ipcRenderer like:\n\n```\nwebview.executeJavaScript(\"ipcRenderer.sendToHost('hello');\");\n```\n"

    "body": "~~In Electron 0.36.7 I find that I cannot do a simple `window.$ = require('jquery');` as it'd fail to find the module. I have to do `window.$ = require('electron').remote.require('jquery');` to do it in the main process. The renderer doesn't seem to have the same module resolution path as the main process~~\n\nActually that doesn't work because jQuery would be running in the main process which doesn't have `document`. And `require('jquery')` didn't work for me because I'm serving the page through HTTP like #4243. To fix this I've tried adding module paths from the main process to the renderer process by:\n\n```\nrequire('electron').remote.process.mainModule.paths.forEach(function(path) {\n    require('module').globalPaths.push(path);\n});\n```\n\nAfter that I can do `require('jquery')` with no problems. Not sure what other impact this may have though\n"

    "body": "@drowlands Including 3party libs in Electron seems to be a bad idea. Imagine the update routine, for instance, or chosing a version.\r\n@amhoho That's because  you need to `require` jQuery, or modify its init code at the top function - leaving only `factory( global );`\r\n\r\nHere:\r\n\r\n```\r\n( function( global, factory ) {\r\n\r\n\t\"use strict\";\r\n\r\n\tif ( typeof module === \"object\" && typeof module.exports === \"object\" ) {\r\n\r\n\t\t// For CommonJS and CommonJS-like environments where a proper `window`\r\n\t\t// is present, execute the factory and get jQuery.\r\n\t\t// For environments that do not have a `window` with a `document`\r\n\t\t// (such as Node.js), expose a factory as module.exports.\r\n\t\t// This accentuates the need for the creation of a real `window`.\r\n\t\t// e.g. var jQuery = require(\"jquery\")(window);\r\n\t\t// See ticket #14549 for more info.\r\n\t\tmodule.exports = global.document ?\r\n\t\t\tfactory( global, true ) :\r\n\t\t\tfunction( w ) {\r\n\t\t\t\tif ( !w.document ) {\r\n\t\t\t\t\tthrow new Error( \"jQuery requires a window with a document\" );\r\n\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t\treturn factory( w );\r\n\t\t\t};\r\n\t} else {\r\n\t\tfactory( global );\r\n\t}\r\n```\r\nI my case I load libs via fetch/Promise or xhr, so I have this routine to remove module checks in vendors' libs.\r\n@RRorg weird what you're saying"
