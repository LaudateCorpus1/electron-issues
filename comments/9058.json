    "body": "> Is the version of electron that called the fork available in the fork somewhere currently and I just missed it?\r\n\r\nIt is not\r\n\r\n> If not, would it be possible to make it available somewhere? Maybe by adding it to process.versions or set process.env.ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE to the version number of electron that calls the fork?\r\n\r\nYeah, should be straight-forward. One concern with setting `process.versions.electron` would be breaking any libraries out there that are assuming a full Electron environment when this is available which wouldn't be the case with forked processes.\r\n\r\nThe code to expose variables to a forked process is in https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/57edc28b0d26934aba91a903f549188ea3e7c48f/atom/app/node_main.cc#L59"
