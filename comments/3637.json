    "body": "Hi @n457 â€” I'm not sure about Linux, but on Mac OS X you can't select a menu item without the menu closing. It's just the way menus are implemented by the system. Similarly, there is no way to programmatically open a menu in the menu bar. You can open contextual menus, but not menus in the menu bar. On Mac OS X, apps that /really/ want to do this can achieve it using crazy Accessibility APIs, but it's very unusual.\n\nSo... no on both counts. Sorry!\n"
