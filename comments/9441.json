Then it will result in different behavior if the user accidentally passes in `undefined` instead of a function. Better to be explicit about it.\r\n\r\nIf there were no backwards-compatibility concerns, IMHO the correct way to solve this would be to have two functions:\r\n\r\n- `menu.popup()`, which is asynchronous and returns a promise.\r\n- `menu.popupSync()`, which is synchronous.\r\n\r\nThis is how all the APIs in Node.js and the community works.\r\n\r\nCould always go the other way though and add `menu.popupAsync()`, which would be a backwards-compatible."
