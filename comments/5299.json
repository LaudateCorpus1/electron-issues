    "body": "> Currently I got the notification system built in my app that's being opened as an external URL, but this way I don't know how to handle on click events (so when the window is hidden it's shown up when clicked on) - since the code is in the app, not main.js.\n\nThis doesn't make much sense to me, can you rephrase?  This might be relevant https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Notification/onclick\n\n> Also, is it possible to disable sounds for native notifications and use HTML5 audio api instead, custom sounds?\n\nSilent Notification --> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Notification/silent\nCustom Sounds --> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/notification/sound\n"
