    "body": "My point is that the `net`component handles automatically proxies in electron, but only for http(s) connections, and I'd like to have something similar for handling proxies for websockets in the main process.\r\n\r\n@arantes555 has built https://github.com/arantes555/electron-fetch to have a polyfill of `fetch` in the main process without using an intermediate `BrowserWindow` which is very useful, especially since the chromium implementation of fetch seems to have issues with proxies on Windows (I've reported it on chromium), and we'd like to be able to do the same with websocket connections as well.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, we've coded a thing similar to what you proposed to handle websocket connections with an intermediate `BrowserWindow` that communicates through IPC but it's really a hack in my opinion."
