    "body": "(for someone who gets around to fixing this)\nFrom recently fixing my own code around this; you can get the correct 'wide character' command line using GetCommandLineW() and then you can convert that to utf-8 for internal use.  (or javascript string or whatever is required)  (even if the startup is just a standard WinMain in non _UNICODE mode is being used you can call GetCommandLineW() ); no need to radically change the build.\n\n---\n\nAlthough I was assuming you're opening a file from the command line to launch electron; and it might be that CreateFileW is really where the error is (or wfopen(?) ).\n"
