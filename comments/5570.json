    "body": "This is currently tracked in upstream Chromium issue: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=568727\n\nWe can not easily just add an API in Electron, because the force touch needs to interactive with DOM events, and it would need work on both Chromium and blink, and probably need time to work out a spec. I'm closing this since we are not able to solve this on Electron's side.\n"
