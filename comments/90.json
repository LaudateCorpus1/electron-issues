    "body": "On OS X this is usually implemented by creating a transparent window and then draw everything within a rounded rect, however in atom-shell the drawing of web page (e.g. webview) is handled by Chromium, and it's drew in rectangle, so in order to add rounded corner to the frameless window, we have to either 1) force clipping the webview in rounded rect, or 2) hook to webview's drawing code. Ideally it should be solved by setting a custom window region, but I couldn't find anything like win32's `SetWindowRgn` in Cocoa.\n\nFor the choice 1, I tried to use Core Animation to clip the webview, but got a rather strange result like this:\n![screen shot 2013-09-11 at 6 09 37 pm](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/639601/1121812/4db4c87a-1aca-11e3-8f50-6202ab680bfe.png)\n\n@obfuscurity Is there a Cocoa expert in GitHub can help on this?\n\nCodes are under `rounded-corner` branch:\nhttps://github.com/atom/atom-shell/blob/rounded-corner/browser/native_window_mac.mm\n"
