    "body": "I tested this. This doesn’t seem to be about the new `title-bar-style` breaking anything; rather, `-webkit-app-region: drag` only seems to work for me with `frame: false`. This does feel like a bug, since the documentation doesn’t limit the dragging working only to frameless windows.\n\nI can definitely see how the drag behaviour would be useful with the new title bar styles as well. Not sure why it’s currently only working with a frameless window, need to dig around a bit more for this.\n"

    "body": "Okay. This comes from Chromium. Apparently, it’s implemented there such that the dragging property only has an effect when `frame: false` is set. But currently, when you set `frame: false`, you can’t get any of the new title bar look/behavior. The two API-s are a bit at odds with each other.\n\nI can think of several ways to solve this, would be interested in feedback before jumping on any of them.\n- Patch Chromium so that `-webkit-app-region: drag` works regardless of the window configuration. (Sometimes it would be useful to have draggable elements in framed windows as well?)\n- Modify the Electron window setup behavior such that if `title-bar-style: hidden`, this to Chromium also means that `frame:false`, yet the title bar (which is invisible, doesn’t take up window content space, but still shows traffic lights) is still drawn on the Electron side.\n"

    "body": "There is another issue that was introduced at the same time that is proving to be really frustrating. Even with `frame: false` draggable regions are only draggable as long as the cursor stays inside them, so if you click and drag a window then it stops dragging when the cursor moves outside the bounds. \n\nThis essentially makes the feature useless in the last several releases.\n"
