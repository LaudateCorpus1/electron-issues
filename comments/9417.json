    "body": "I guess you're using windows 10 (or maybe 8) and have a system hiDPI scale setting of 125%, is that right? On windows, this is due to upstream Chrome's behaviour change, it now \"respects\" the system-wide HiDPI settings.\r\n\r\nI can think out 2 solutions:\r\n- disable this behaviour by setting chrome flags, use some code like this in your `app.js`:\r\n```js\r\nif (process.platform === 'win32') {\r\n  app.commandLine.appendSwitch('high-dpi-support', 'true')\r\n  app.commandLine.appendSwitch('force-device-scale-factor', '1')\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n- adapt your app with this new change, e.g. setting your browser's own scale, make your app content more responsive.\r\n\r\np.s. I don't know exactly if the same happens on Linux, if so, the above code should also work (and don't forget to change the platform check)"
