    "body": "Hey @zcbenz - I think we can close this issue but this is something to keep an eye on. I had similar issues with Chrome 51 and Canary 53 (`chrome://gpu` reporting hardware acceleration was disabled). It appears related to the latest release of ATI drivers but cannot confirm yet. I reformatted my system and let Windows automatically install an older Radeon driver 15.11 versus 16.6.1 and everything appears to be working correctly. I'm worried newer drivers will break again so am holding off updating. \n\nI'll report the issue ATI support as well.\n\nJust to note - the `ignore-gpu-blacklist` had to no effect either.\n"
