So apps must implement event handler for \"plus\" button, or clicking will do nothing?\r\n\r\n@tonyganch right, it assumes that if you're opting into tabbing behavior with a `tabbingIdentifier`, then you'll also provide a way for a user to create a new tab on their own. If that turns out not to be a correct assumption, then electron would need to provide apps with a way to specify if the new tab button should be visible.\r\n\r\n> This is very cool. Also curious how this actually works as consumer. I guess it is fine to let apps handle this event provided they can actually force open a new tab. Otherwise this is hard to implement correctly I guess.\r\n\r\n@bpasero I have an example of how to handle the event [in the sample app](https://github.com/danielma/electron-quick-start/blob/native-new-tab-button/main.js#L34), but if there's more information I could provide, please let me know"
