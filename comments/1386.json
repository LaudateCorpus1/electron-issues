    "body": "Can this be modified to include response headers? Or when the event gets fired no actual network traffic occurs in Chromium? I would expect at least a HEAD request is being done to check the cache state.\n\nI would like to use this to catch download events, but since this event fires for other resource requests as well, and doesn't state that Chromium will not handle the event internally, i can't be sure if i should check the URL manually for a downloadable resource or not. If the response headers would be there, i could check for eg. the presence of the `Content-Disposition` header and assume that Chromium will throw away this request in a later stage.\n\nI have an open SO question for this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30094896/catch-file-download-events-in-electron-app\n"
