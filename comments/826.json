    "body": "As long as we are talking about Windows build instructions I think they should be updated to reflect that Visual Studio 2013 Community Edition works well for compiling Atom-Shell. I gave it a good run through today. Additionally it might be nice to comment on the fact that the Visual Studio 2013 Command Prompt is really all you need in addition to Python, Node and Git. \n\nI guess most casual programmers wouldn't know about the Visual Studio Command Prompt because it's buried in the install directory and one has to go looking for it and it's not obvious unless you know about it.\n\nOne last thought, the directions mention Windows 2008 at least. Perhaps it should be noted that the build works on 2008, Windows 8, 8.1 and Windows 10 technical preview. \n\nI lied, I have another point and that is that apparently the atom-package-manager Node module is needed and is not automatically fulfilled. I learned that today (and apparently forgot that fact before) and had to install it manually after my boostrap failed.\n"

Install Python 2.7.x\n2. Make sure the Python install directory is added to your PATH variable\n3. Install Node.JS 32 bit\n4. Make sure npm is added to your PATH variable. This should be automatically done via Node.JS installer\n5. I had to install atom-package-manager manually: npm install -g atom-package-manager\n6. Install Git from http://git-scm.com/\n7. Make sure you can access the git commands from your PATH variable.\n8. Install Visual Studio 2013 Community Edition\n9. Open Visual Studio 2013 Command Prompt: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\\Common7\\Tools\\VsDevCmd.bat\n\nGrab the code and run the Atom-Shell bootstrap and build as detailed here:\n\nhttps://github.com/atom/atom-shell/blob/master/docs/development/build-instructions-windows.md\n```\n"
