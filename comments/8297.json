You need to recursively call AboutToShow(item_id) + update the layout on your side via GetLayout() to expand it. The pygobject (Canonicals global menu implementation uses GLib) documentation is unfortunately pretty sparse so I had to go through the electron source code to realize this (you can find a list of the different item props in the file I've linked). \r\nPseudocode:\r\n```\r\nexpand(item):\r\n    if [item has children]:\r\n        call AboutToShow(item_id)\r\n        call GetLayout()\r\n        for children in item: #You need to find item again, my code is structured a bit differently but essentially you can use GetLayouts first parameter for this\r\n            expand(child)\r\n```\r\nAlso if you are familiar with canonicals global menu/ know a STABLE client for the unity-gtk-module I would be extremely thankful if you could point me to some info becuase I've implemented [this API](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GLib/GApplication/DBusAPI) and it works but is super unstable (I've just tried [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44143643) but it doesn't seem to work :()\r\n"

So I think you are right. \r\n\r\nAlso, the second link you provided is for DBusMenu, thus it is not related to unity-gtk-module (I think). \r\n\r\nThis project [vala-panel-appmenu](https://github.com/rilian-la-te/vala-panel-appmenu) implement an good client for unity-gtk-module (org.gtk.Menus). It use a [submodule](https://github.com/rilian-la-te/vala-dbusmenu) library, which you should look closely into.\r\n\r\nIt vala-appmenu project also provided and implementation for the Registrar interface, but have the same problem with i3-hud-service.py. Me and the author are also working on expose the full layout for electron apps and non-qt apps that use DBusMenu, you can track these bugs [1](https://github.com/rilian-la-te/vala-panel-appmenu/issues/89#issuecomment-303785657), [2](https://github.com/rilian-la-te/vala-dbusmenu/issues/6).

My problem is that some gtk-applications (gimp) tend to crash (sporadically) when I Activate() an entry, and I tried to fix this by not using the ghetto method of exposing the whole menu on the bus but actually using Gios way of retrieving a menu from the bus and casting it to a gtk.Menu object. I will look into how vala-panel does this.\r\n\r\nThe bugreport you linked indicates that you think the problem lies at the Registrar which is not really the case (I also use i3-hud-service.py). What you have to do is expand the menu shortly before processing it, because the glib menu is mutable and can change 'on-the-fly'.\r\nSo you need to fix your hud-menu.py, the vala-panel registrar works fine."

I'll see whether or not I can get python to work with a gtk Menu casted from a DBusMenuModel when I have some time.\r\n\r\n@snippins Seems like using Start() for your purpose should work ok, but I wouldn't be too surprised if some applications just crash after some time. \r\n\r\nEdit: Upon further inspection it seems like the cause is us bruteforcing the menu with `[x for x in range(1024)]`. Gio throws an error: [`GLib-GIO:ERROR:gmenuexporter.c:395:g_menu_exporter_group_unsubscribe: assertion failed: (group->subscribed >= count)`](https://github.com/GNOME/glib/blob/master/gio/gmenuexporter.c#L392), so I presume theres an unhandled edge-case in GLib (haven't had the time to dig into the code tho, so can't say I'm 100% sure). The solution would be a recursive approach similar to com.canonical.dbusmenu (or using the DBusMenuModel proxy)."

Then we can run a Glib mainloop to listen to the events inside. The iterating methods works just fine inside these methods. You can check the code [here](https://gist.github.com/snippins/255db0c804a2a81815ad484909ea241c). To use it you can do something like \"sleep 3 && thatfile.py\" then quicky switch to some gtk app. I am able to retrieve almost everything.\r\n\r\nBut I am not familiar with this stuff and dont know how to go further yet. How to know when to stop?"

    "body": "@snippins  Ohhh that makes sense. You're right, there needs to be a mainloop running for the whole thing to work. I've actually looked into the GLib source code and [DBusMenuModel asks for the main context](https://github.com/GNOME/glib/blob/f924d0b1f7d2b019f1abb56685dcfda74266c608/gio/gdbusmenumodel.c#L886). When looking for the path, it [doesn't find it](https://github.com/GNOME/glib/blob/f924d0b1f7d2b019f1abb56685dcfda74266c608/gio/gdbusmenumodel.c#L321) and creates it. But that path is not linked to the actual menu on the bus.\r\n\r\nThis is also the first time for me having to work with GLib, so I'm also pretty clueless about whether there's a way to bypass this. What I think we have to do is query an arbitrary signal, enter the mainloop, use the signal to trigger menu-discovery, and exit with quit().\r\n\r\nWhat do you mean with 'almost'? Does it crash for you or not? I found that crashes seem to be pretty arbitrary and dependent on the time between opening a new window and running Start(), but when 'stress'-testing, I crash pretty consistantly."

Then for each sub item we hook the event, which is also a GMenuModel. It keeps expanding like that and each event is treat as equals, we never know when all of them are done.\r\n\r\nI think I know the way to do it now though. The parent event can be block by a loop waiting for its child event to completed, thus back to normal tree traversal. Just need some signal between the parent and childs events.\r\n\r\nLOL i use 1 window mode in gimp.\r\n\r\nEdit: Sr for a lot of typos"
