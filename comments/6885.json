    "body": "The first item sounds pretty similar to #528 which many people have commented would be useful 👍 \n\nThe second item sounds great too 👍 \n\n> We'd like to know in advance as we need those features and if you don't think you'd merge those requests we'd skip implementing this and rebuild the behavior in html somewhat.\n\nWe can't say definitively what will get merged without seeing how it is implemented first but both items you mentioned seem valuable to Electron.\n\nI'm going to close this issue out, feel free to open your pull request(s) early on in the process and we can discuss API and implementation details there, thanks for considering making these contributions 🙌 \n"
