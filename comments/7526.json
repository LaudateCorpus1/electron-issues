    "body": "Thanks for the tips!\n\nBesides adding glib to LD_LIBRARY_PATH I also added **glibc:**\n1. I downloaded glibc-2.17-106.el7_2.6.x86_64.rpm from [rpmfind](http://www.rpmfind.net/linux/rpm2html/search.php?query=glibc+2.17&submit=Search+...&system=&arch=), got the binaries (unzip or something) and added them to LD_LIBRARY_PATH.\n2. Using [patchelf](http://nixos.org/patchelf.html) I updated two things to force the binary to use the updated **ld-linux** from **glibc-2.17**:\n\n```\npatchelf --set-interpreter /path/to/glibc/.../ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 /path/to/electron/bin/../electron\npatchelf --replace-needed ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 /path/to/glibc/.../ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 /path/to/electron/bin/../electron\n```\n\nI have also made a small list of resources that help me in some way with this issue:\n- https://github.com/feross/webtorrent-hybrid/issues/40\n- https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/297\n- https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/2177\n- https://github.com/mattermost/desktop/issues/312\n- https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/527\n"
