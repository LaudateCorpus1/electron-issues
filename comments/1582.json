    "body": "This is just based on just looking at the code but here are some suggestions of what to try.  I haven't tried them so you're on your own. \n\nBrackets doesn't rely on any 3rd party code for its dark shell implementation.  Electron implements its native windowing using aura and then has some platform specific and non-platform specific code to manage those windows, their creation and styling in the code found in  https://github.com/atom/electron/tree/browser/. I presume you could fork Electron and \nhandle this natively similarly to the way Brackets handles it (there isn't a \"node\" way to do it which is what I had originally thought) \n\nFor Windows you could try adding the code which handles native window drawing (cef_window, cef_dark_window, cef_host_window, etc...) into your fork and subclassing the native window in https://github.com/atom/electron/blob/master/atom/browser/native_window_views.cc  with code similar to: \n\n``` c++\n      cef_popup_window *w = new cef_popup_window();  // gets destroyed in cef_popup_window::PostNcDestroy\n      w->SubclassWindow(GetAcceleratedWidget());\n```\n\n`NativeWindowViews::NativeWindowViews`  is where wIndow styles are applied to the window on Windows so this would be a good place to try hacking the code.  \n\nOur cef_window code is built in layers so we could turn features on and off as needed which is why there are so many classes and preprocessor flags but it relies very little on cef and don't make much use of cef directly so electron should slip right in. The top level classes in the hierarchy will depend on cef to some degree but I think those dependencies could just be removed or made to work with atom...  There are the png resources for the buttons that you'll need to bring in and the window title that you may need to figure out as well.  Hopefully WM_SETTEXT works in that case.\n\nFor Mac you would need to copy our cocoa UI Builder xml files into the atom project and add them to the project then modify https://github.com/atom/electron/blob/master/atom/browser/native_window_mac.mm directly to support the dark ui much the way we did in client_handler_mac.mm then bring over TrafficLights_, CustomView_ and FullScreen\\* into the project.\n"

Check out https://github.com/atom/electron/blob/master/docs/api/frameless-window.md. You don't have to implement drag, but you do have to implement wiring up the window buttons to call methods on the Window, but that's pretty easy. \n"

I think right now it only occupies the space above the editor.  Also you want to detect which platform you're on so that you can have native looking UI images for each platform and place them on the correct side of the window.  That means making images for Linux.\n\nOne thing to note -- you may want different traffic lights for Yosemite so that it looks like a Yosemite app. When Yosemite came out we had to back-pedal a bit on the traffic lights because designers wanted it should look like Yosemite when running on Yosemite.\n"
