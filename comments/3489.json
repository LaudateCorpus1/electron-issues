    "body": "Thanks @zcbenz, I was trying to sign the frameworks via `versions/current` instead of via `versions/a`.\n\nI modified the script there and got it to work. The `export CODESIGN_ALLOCATE` there was not necessary.\n\nHere is a reduced and simple script which works and does the minimum of signing (without signing things twice):\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/jorangreef/27e708c67b7e6746a98a\n\nIt's a few seconds quicker and passes Gatekeeper. Hope this helps anyone else, and thanks again for the pointers.\n"
