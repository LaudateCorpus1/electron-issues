For the time being I would suggest avoiding any synchronous `loadURL` calls made inside any of the navigation observers like `webContents.on('did-fail-load', () => { webContents.loadURL() })`, as they would be the main cause for this crash."

I can reproduce this with this app:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst electron = require('electron')\r\nconst app = electron.app\r\nconst BrowserWindow = electron.BrowserWindow\r\n\r\nlet mainWindow\r\n\r\nfunction createWindow () {\r\n  mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({\r\n    width: 800, \r\n    height: 600\r\n  })\r\n\r\n  setTimeout(() => {\r\n    setInterval(() => {\r\n      mainWindow.webContents.stop()\r\n      mainWindow.loadURL('http://google.com')\r\n    }, 0)\r\n  }, 1000)\r\n\r\n  mainWindow.on('closed', function () {\r\n    mainWindow = null\r\n  })\r\n}\r\n\r\napp.on('ready', createWindow)\r\n\r\napp.on('window-all-closed', function () {\r\n  if (process.platform !== 'darwin') {\r\n    app.quit()\r\n  }\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, if you use the sandbox option, the crash doesn't happen. This is as far as I got with this, I hope it helps. :)\r\n"
