    "body": "Hi,\n\nI've tried @kimak sample on windows os.\n\nHere's my configuration :\n- Electron version: v0.36.7\n- Operating system: Windows 10 PRO 64 bit\n- widevine-cdm-version 1.4.8.866\n\nAs it's hard to find the right widevinecmadapter.dll, I've found the `47.0.2526.73` version which is a little more old than electron chromium version.\n\nWhen I tests your sample as is with the `http://www.dash-player.com/demo/drm-test-area/`. It works. \n\nIf I modify the code of `main.js` to load shaka player I faced to EME error\n`\n mainWindow.loadURL('http://shaka-player-demo.appspot.com/');\n`\nerror :\n`Unable to create the CDM for the key system com.widevine.alpha.`\n\non the other side \n\nIf I let the \"dash-player test page\" by default and navigate to the \"shaka player\" page by changing the location url all shaka player widevine streams are playing well.\n\nI've you met the same problem on other OS ? I'm interested about some solution or workaround, and if someone has a way to find the exact version of the dll I'm also interested.\n\nRegards\n"
