    "body": "This is weird, I would expect `no-cors` to bypass the CORS checking for referrer. I suggest reporting this to Chromium's issues list instead, since it is likely a bug of blink.\n\nI'm closing this since the rules of CORS are hard coded in blink, and we are not able to work around this on Electron's side.\n"
