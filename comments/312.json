While Clojurescript could be a problem I've written a bunch of code using it inside Node-Webkit and haven't had any issues like the screenshot suggests. The basic thing I'm trying to do is simply write the hello-app in Clojurescript. Nothing complex and everything seems quite straight forward. All the pertinent info is in the original post above.\n\n![atom-shell-error-clojurescript](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/190154/3016687/03653450-df71-11e3-8fa8-5869806ea45a.PNG)\n"
