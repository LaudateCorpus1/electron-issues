    "body": "It is not supported to run another V8 thread in the renderer process, to do it we have to add `v8::Locker` in the main thread, however blink doesn't do that and we are not able to touch that part of code.\n\nTo workaround this, you can use the module in the main process, or run it in a script forked by `child_process.fork`.\n"
