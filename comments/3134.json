    "body": "If i downloaded nodejs from https://github.com/nodejs/node, and modified fs.js, then node will report error message that:\n\n```\nA03101308207:Release minggo$ ./node\nfs.js:37\nconst errnoException = util._errnoException;\n                       ^\n\nReferenceError: util is not defined\n    at fs.js:37:24\n    at NativeModule.compile (node.js:952:5)\n    at NativeModule.require (node.js:900:18)\n    at module.js:9:12\n    at NativeModule.compile (node.js:952:5)\n    at Function.NativeModule.require (node.js:900:18)\n    at startup (node.js:138:35)\n    at node.js:961:3\nA03101308207:Release minggo$ \n```\n\nSo i think the error message of node core module is eaten in electron. I don't know where the codes is and why do it like this. \n\nAny idea?\n"
