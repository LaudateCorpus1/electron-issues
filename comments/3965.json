    "body": "Thank you for your attention, and have a happy 2016 btw! \nI finally managed to fix the issue! What was happening is that the c++ library tries to cache some files in a temp directory, that I need to set before starting any song, but I was just setting it by passing something like `('./temp-dir')`. So the thing is, if I ran from shell script or \"npm start\" it creates the dir right on actual directory, but if i ran by double clicking .app , the OSX doesn't know how to \"resolve\" that `('./temp-dir')` path and cannot create the temp directory. \nSo in order to fix it, i used `app.getPath('temp')`, from Electron, to set up that temp directory. Gladly it works fine!\n"
