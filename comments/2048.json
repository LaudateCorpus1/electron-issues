    "body": "I'd probably do it this way. Instead of loading Google in the mainWindow using loadUrl I'd instead create a basic HTML page that contains a webview that loads Google. I'd then create a small JS file to load in the webview preload. This script would require jQuery like this:\n\n``` javascript\nwindow.$ = window.jQuery = require('./bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js');\n```\n\nThen in that small script I'd do whatever other code you need to do in order to intercept and manipulate elements on the Google page.\n\nAt least that is what I am thinking off the top of my head. I'm sure there are other ways to do it.\n"

Eg. if it's in main.js then you can use IPC to communicate from your browser side JS to the backend main.js code to call it. Or you can use the Remote API from your browser side code to grab the current BrowserWindow object and then call the method you need. If node integration is turned off you can do it via Socket IO (or similar technology) to communicate from the browser code to the main.js code in order to call the method.\n\nRemote API: https://github.com/atom/electron/blob/master/docs/api/remote.md\n\nWebview can be done in pretty much the same fashion, if node-integration is turned off wire up an event handler in your preload script so that it can be called from the code loading in the webview. If it's turned on do it like above (whatever you prefer).\n\nThere may be other ways to do it but this is just off the top of my head.

    "body": "@dizawish I don't know what is going on now. I just tried the google manipulation code I wrote a long time ago and it fails in the preload script because window.onload never seems to be called or it's called before preload script loads now. This is different behavior to past Electron releases so I'm not really sure. Although I did manage to get it to work by refactoring my preload script a bit. I no longer rely on window.onload but instead use an interval to check the document.readystate and then inject jQuery, change the text in the google search input field and clear the interval. I've tested this against Electron 1.6.10 and 1.7.2 (beta).\r\n\r\nThe following repository has this code:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/frankhale/electron-inject-jquery-webview-example"
