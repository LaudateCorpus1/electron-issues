    "body": "Electron doesn't require or help how you run tests, it is no different from running any other browser based tests. I suggest asking the [forum](https://discuss.atom.io/c/electron) for help since many people have their own ways of running specs.\n\nFor running Electron itself's specs, you can look at the [Build instructions](https://github.com/atom/electron/blob/master/docs/development/build-instructions-mac.md) in docs.\n"
