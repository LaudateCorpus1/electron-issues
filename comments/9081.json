    "body": "This won't be an issue with Electron persay, it could be any number of things stopping the rename occurring.  If any other process has a file lock on that file then it won't be permitted.\r\n\r\nThe most common causes are AV programs or even your own code attempting to read from the file while attempting to rename it.  If you use a module like `fs-extra` it will be nice and retry a few times in case it's a temporary file lock issue.\r\n\r\nYou also might get better results using the async version of the `fs` methods.\r\n\r\nClosing out as it's not an issue with Electron itself üëç "
