    "body": "I too have seen this kind of weird behaviour and I thought it had more to do with the fact I'm using lots of Shadow DOM and styles inside a shadow tree and that the Shadow DOM implementation in Blink is kind of experimental.\n\nSpecifically, I've seen cases where setting a class on an element via JS doesn't cause the CSS rules to be applied and the element to render with the new appearance until later. By \"until later\" I mean some vague time or event later on. For example, inspecting an element with dev tools often gives it a kick and causes it to render correctly. Changing the focus from my Electron app to another app and then back may also 'fix' the situation.\n\nI'm using Kubuntu Linux 15.10. This behaviour has been going on for quite a few major Electron releases, at least 6 months.\n"
