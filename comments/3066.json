    "body": "You have to wrap the hyphen separated options with quotes, i.e. change your example code to this\n\n``` js\nouathWindow = new BrowserWindow({\n  width: 640,\n  height: 480,\n  'always-on-top': true\n});\n```\n\nIt's very unfortunate a choice was made to use hyphens instead of underscores, or perhaps better yet, camelCasing. But that's the way it is, and it's unlikely it will ever change sadly.\n"
