    "body": "So what I'm requesting is that libchromium be configurable to use any one of its many process models. In Electron's current state, libchromium uses its default process-per-site-instance model. Every time a dialog is opened, a new window is spawned, etc -- a new process is spawned to render that window. This makes sense in the context of a web browser, but leads to unnecessary memory usage in a desktop application. Making this configurable would allow those of us whose apps don't need advanced security models like process-per-site-instance to optimize our applications.\n"
