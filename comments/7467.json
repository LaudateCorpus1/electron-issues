    "body": "@kevinsawicki thanks for your reply.\n\n> Is it only the Tab key that isn't working for you? Is your page not receiving the event or is the event data just wrong/incomplete?\n\nYes, it's only the tab key. The page does receive a keyboard event as expected but `keyCode: 'Tab'` seems to be ignored in 1.4.0 and above.\n\nBasically, I have an on-screen QWERTY keyboard which allows users to input their info into 2 input fields. All keys work as expected in Electron 1.4.2 except the tab key. In 1.3.7, the tab key works.\n\nIn my project, the tab key should mimic the tab key on the physical keyboard to set the focus from one field to the next.\n\nTaking cues from your response, I've put together a simple test to demonstrate this:\n\n``` js\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n    <title></title>\n    <style>\n      webview {\n        position: absolute;\n        top: 0;\n        left: 0;\n        right: 0;\n        bottom: 0\n      }\n    </style>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <webview src=\"http://purplemass.com/temp/electron-test.html\" />\n    <script>\n    webView = document.querySelector('webview');\n\n    webView.addEventListener(\"dom-ready\", function(event) {\n      // webView.openDevTools();\n      webViewContent = webView.getWebContents();\n\n      webViewContent.sendInputEvent({ type: 'char', keyCode: 'A'});\n      webViewContent.sendInputEvent({ type: 'char', keyCode: 'B'});\n\n      webViewContent.sendInputEvent({ type: 'keyDown', keyCode: 'Tab'});\n      webViewContent.sendInputEvent({ type: 'char', keyCode: ''});\n\n      webViewContent.sendInputEvent({ type: 'char', keyCode: 'C'});\n      webViewContent.sendInputEvent({ type: 'char', keyCode: 'D'});\n      webViewContent.sendInputEvent({ type: 'char', keyCode: 'E'});\n\n      webViewContent.sendInputEvent({ type: 'keyDown', keyCode: 'Backspace'});\n    });\n\n    </script>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\nThe above code puts **AB** into **input1** and **CD** into **input2** in Electron 1.3.7.\n\nIn 1.4.2, I get **ABCD** in **input1**.\n\nIt's interesting to note that when a key is pressed on a physical keyboard, the keyboard event contains `event.key`, `event.code` and `event.keyCode`. Using Electron's `sendInputEvent`, `event.key` and `event.code` are empty but I think this is the expected behaviour.\n"

Using Electron's sendInputEvent, event.key and event.code are empty but I think this is the expected behaviour.\n\nI think this might be the issue, perhaps the recent Chrome upgrade caused this to stop working because the event generated by `sendInputEvent` don't have the `key` and `code` set on them.\n\nIf I set those fields locally on master then I do see your example working as it did in 1.3.7 which is good.\n"
