On some systems they are shown on top right corner of the screen (mac os, ubuntu), some on bottom right corner (windows 10, kubuntu); on some systems they are clickable (kubuntu, mac os), on some they are not (ubuntu)\n"

In the  browser project that I'm working on (described in #8534), I'd really like to make the start page (when you start a browser or add a tab) a feed type list of your recent HTML5 notifications. For me this is much better than a modal that interrupts. It's also probably the first step in a true open source type facebook thingy. I would propose electron simply add a runInBackground attribute in BrowserWindow and let the UI decide how to handle any inbound notifications with a generic event."
