    "body": "Hi, all i know about requireJs is that they have similar require method with node which conflicted, try use requirejs as subtitute method.\n<quote>\nBest practice: Use npm to install Node-only packages/modules into the projects node_modules directory, but do not configure RequireJS to look inside the node_modules directory. Also avoid using relative module IDs to reference modules that are Node-only modules. So, do not do something like require(\"./node_modules/foo/foo\").\n</quote>\n\nlook further for http://requirejs.org/docs/node.html\n"

    "body": "@cniaulin A workaround would be to free the `require` variable by renaming it to something else before loading `require.js` as follows:\n\n``` html\n<script>\n  if (window.require) {\n    window.nodeRequire = window.require;\n    delete window.require;\n  }\n</script>\n```\n\nYou'll need to call `nodeRequire` wherever you want to call Node.js version of `require`.\n"
