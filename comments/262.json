Bummer.\n\nI am usually not a Windows user, let alone Windows app developer, however I recently won a Microsoft Surface and realize I really miss not being able to receive SMS notifications on my Surface from my iPhone, like my Macbook does. I hope to develop this project with Electron, although this lack of Windows notification support puts a speed bump in that plan.\n"

Can I shim notification API somehow, so it does tray bubble instead?\n\nThe thing is, I can't change the clientside code, cause I am loading it from public url. The app is just packaged webapp.\n\nHowever, if I were able to shim Notification API from the main script, it would be awesome. Do you know whether something like that is possible?\n\nThanks a lot!\n"

I downloaded electron from https://github.com/atom/electron/releases\n2. I created a shortcut by 'right click on electron.exe -> create shortcut'\n3. I edited the app UserModelId to `com.squirrel.electron.electron` (I used the trick here to edit the property: http://winaero.com/blog/how-to-show-more-details-for-shortcuts-in-windows-8-1-windows-8-and-windows-7/)\n4. I dragged the shortcut to windows start menu (literally dragged the shortcut on to the windows start icon at bottom left..)\n5. I clicked open the shortcut from start screen to launch electron.exe\n6. I opened devtool and typed in this:\n   `\n   electron = require('electron');\n   electron.remote.app.setAppUserModelId('com.squirrel.electron.electron');\n   `\n7. I typed in\n   `\n   var n = new window.Notification('hi');\n   `\n8. I wasn't able to see notification : - |\n\nIs it because by the time I setAppUserModelId it was too late? Does it matter?\n"
