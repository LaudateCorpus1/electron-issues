    "body": "One idea could be that there is a setting in Electron that brings back native tabs. That way a user can after all decide if tabs should be on or off (surfaced via some kind of user setting). This flag would basically return the \"Show Tab Bar\" to the view menu (probably requires a restart).\r\n\r\n@kevinsawicki is there any pointers for a similar case of a setting that I could use as starting point to look into?"
