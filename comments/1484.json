Node can do everything php can and is more suitable for an electron like use-case where we need to do async stuff and we just can't afford to block the event loop.\n\nIf you are new to node, I would suggest you have a look at [this](https://gist.github.com/LeCoupa/985b82968d8285987dc3) cheatsheet and for MySQL You can use [node-mariasql](https://github.com/mscdex/node-mariasql) or for a nicer API [mariasql-promise](https://github.com/steelbrain/mariasql-promise).\n"

That project alone has 61 stars on Github as of now. There are actually several PHP desktop app containers out their with pretty decent user bases.\n\nIf it comes to writing the desktop project from scratch I wouldn't use PHP since I know JavaScript and know Electron well. However a lot of users wanting this are wanting to interact with the machine using PHP for one of several reasons.\n1. The application is already written in PHP. And there is no concerns of exposing the server side to the client side.\n2. They are a strong PHP developer. And prefer to stick to PHP as their language. (Keep in mind it isn't insane to use a backend language like PHP. Node.js after all is considered a backend language too.\n3. Who knows. Who cares.\n\nSo I agree PHP support doesn't need to be added to Electron. But if someone wants to then all the power to them.\n\nI am currently rewriting PHP-Webkit from a boilerplate to be an actual NPM module an Electron or NW.js user can simply require and include PHP projects a little bit easier. Unfortunately it is a time permitting kind of thing.\n"

There is a extra overhead to enabling PHP in Electron due to the JavaScript-oriented nature of the system, but it's not fundamentally wrong. \n\nPHP isn't just for servers/backend stuff. It excels at that, but it can be primarily used for both client-focused stuff and backend-focused stuff. Just like JavaScript is now thanks to Node. \n\nIt makes sense why someone would want to enable processing of PHP files because a ton of websites, web apps and open source projects (Wordpress, MediaWiki, etc.) use PHP. If Electron is being billed as a way to run web apps on the desktop, enabling pre-processing of HTML makes sense even if there is a slight resource overhead for doing the pre-processing for every page load. \n\nI think it's not the most efficient method to get the job done using Electron, PHP apps would probably be slightly out-performed by an identical app that's undergone a JS rewrite, but given the pros vs a slight performance hit, it makes sense for this to be a thing. Especially if it's a stepping stone for people to actually do the rewrites in JavaScript. Think of it kind of like training wheels for fully adopting this much more modern app distribution model.\n"

    "body": "Just got it working as a low priority task for work a week ago, so too early to blog about it.  Basically just dockerize your PHP app, in my case this was an official Nginx container, an official MariaDB container and a customized official PHP7-FPM container (on a Mac you'll want to sign up for and use the Docker native beta).  Tie them together with docker-compose, enter a /etc/hosts entry for the web server locally, then just point the Electron renderer (usually main.js) to the hostname.  It's really slow, rendering the same docker group in the browser is easily 5x faster than in Electron (not sure why yet), but seems to be fully functional.  Packaging (that I have not gotten to yet) is going to be important as you'll have to have a version of docker and docker-compose verified or installed first and a host file entry working (still easier than keeping a native local LAMP stack installed).  Customizing the dockers to run for a single desktop user is also going to be important as by default they each grab 2Gb of memory and way too many default procs for a desktop app, so I was running a very slow install of Drupal 7 in Electron at almost 7Gb of RAM with the mostly default containers.  Drupal 8 seems to have an install bug with Nginx, but the plan is to use that with the Waterwheel project and Electron/Node for our app and Drupal/PHP will just be the backend for managing a ton of dynamic content.\n"

    "body": "## hey hey hey!\n\ni finally found the easiest solution to do php stuff in electron\n\nso basically, i think all php GET request are possible in electron, POST request actually not really\n\nfirst of, you need to have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and npm (included in node.js), but i think you probably already have that\n\nthen, go to command line (as admin) and type:\n\n`cd C:\\Program Files (x86)\\nodejs`\n\nthen:\n\n`npm install xhr`\n\nthen go to `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\nodejs\\node_modules\\xhr`, and copy the `index.js` to your original web app directory (and rename it to `xhr.js`)\n\nnow include this inside the head tag of your `index.html` or `index.php`:\n`<script src=\"xhr.js\"></script>`\n\n## now, the complex part:\n\ngo to your main javascript file and convert all javascript, jquery or ajax post requests to xhr post requests by hand, just google the syntax of the xhr function for help with that or follow the example below\n\nso you should just have post requests like this:\n\n```\nxhr = (window.XMLHttpRequest) ? new XMLHttpRequest() : new activeXObject(\"Microsoft.XMLHTTP\");\nxhr.open( 'post', '/path/to/some.php', true );\nxhr.send(somedata);\n```\n\nthis part is very important! you have to use xhr methods to get it working\n\n<hr>\n\nso, that's the solution...no embedding, not much extra code, no gulp-php-stuff\n\njust rebuild your app now and it should work\n\n<hr>\n\nPS: answers like \"doing this would make no sense, now learn a new language please\" when someone asks for a easy workaround at least, are just bullshit...sorry for saying that, but as developers we all know that we first want to look for an easy way to do things with the resources we have...just ignoring the question and making the asker feel super bad for not wanting to rewrite his whole app, THAT makes no sense...php is just a language and i assume the right to use it like i want, damn\n\n## peace out\n"
