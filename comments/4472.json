    "body": "I've managed to find a shadow issue on 10.11 now too. It manifests itself a bit differently though, see attached screenshot. On 10.10, this window will either show with a shadow or without it. On 10.11 it consistently shows a lumpy shadow like below. The 50ms hack fixes the issue on both operating systems for me.\n\n![screen shot 2016-06-27 at 15 50 43](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/26971/16384311/555115fe-3c80-11e6-9cb9-f5cb484c8328.png)\n\nThis may well be an issue specific to my app. I can't find anything unusual that I'm doing though, the app is being rendered using React.\n"
