    "body": "> I have no choice but to ask the question in issue.\r\n\r\nðŸ˜¢ \r\n\r\nGitHub issues are for feature requests and bug reports, questions about using Electron should be directed to the [community](https://github.com/electron/electron#community) or to the [Slack Channel](http://atom-slack.herokuapp.com/).\r\n\r\nFWIW a cursory google search results in http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12997123/print-specific-part-of-webpage which appears to be what you want to do.  There are two main approaches to this.\r\n\r\n* Take the content you want to print, put it in it's own window and print that window  \r\n* Hide all the content you don't want to print and then print the current window (You can do this with `media=\"print\"` stylesheets"
