This does not seem to happen on single page apps, but only when the page reloads.\n\nMore interestingly if I add my `preload.js` with the event handlers to the `index.html` (so my main script) then I tap fast enough on links, I noticed that sometimes when the page reloads the main script catches the touch events although I'm still tapping on the webview. And when this happens the touch stops firing the `click` event, even outside the webview. This does not seem to happen in the mentioned Chrome extension.\n\nThe only thing I can think about that is different in Chrome is that Electron forces the renderer to restart for every navigation (based on https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/4985#issuecomment-243041839), so might be something related to that code. But in the Chrome extension this 'touch event bleed through' cannot be reproduced even when I navigate across different domains.\n\nI'm open to any ideas of what I should test next.\n"

    "body": "Some more info:\r\n\r\n- I'm seeing two different types of (maybe related) errors.\r\n- As described above, if you leave a finger on the screen while refreshing the webview, the webview ends up in a state where it gets `touchstart` and `touchend` events, but no `click` events are fired and scrolling doesn't work. Using a mouse still works, but touches don't trigger clicks or scrolls. The `touches` array in the event object for `touchstart` and `touchend` are accurate (they correctly reflect the touches on the screen). This case is consistently reproducible.\r\n- Every once in a while, Electron will end up in a similar state *without* refreshing the webview. The most consistent way i've found to reproduce this is to place one finger on the screen, then a second, then lift both fingers. It's easiest to reproduce right after starting the app. In this problematic state, we see similar behavior (`touchstart` and `touchend` without `click` or scrolling), but we see a phantom touch in the `touches` array -- there's an extra touch in the array that doesn't correspond to a physical touch on the screen. Sometimes, this state goes away after using the mouse. However, our users report that the app is totally frozen, because they're using it on a touchscreen with no mouse or keyboard, and from their perspective, touching and scrolling is unresponsive.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the operating system continues to work fine, so this doesn't appear to be a hardware or OS issue."
