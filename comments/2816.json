But the problem we need to solve in our current architecture is how to pass one webframes' datasource to another newly created frame.\nOne solution is to set the opener of a frame in native side and during `LoadURL` first give renderer a chance for navigation (if it has POST data).\n- guest.LoadURL\n- Send IPC to renderer to give chance for POST navigation\n- Get the opener of the frame and check if it has POST dataSource\n- Use `WebFrame::Load` to navigate and return IPC result whether to continue browser navigation.\n\nAny other implementaion ideas ?\n"

So we might need to patch chromium to change the type of `browser_initiated_post_data` similar to the one in this quite old but relevant [CL](https://codereview.chromium.org/11193051/) which tries to handle cross process POST navigations. If patching the type is fine then can proceed with your suggestion.\n"
