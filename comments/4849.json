    "body": "I can reproduce this on Electron 1.4.3, OS X 10.11.6.\n\nThe code in the above comment has some syntax errors. Here's how I'm able to reproduce:\n\n``` js\ndialog.showOpenDialog(mainWindow, {properties: [\"openDirectory\"]}, (paths = []) => {\n  console.log('closed dialog')\n})\n\nmainWindow.hide()\n```\n\nThe error only seems to occur if `hide()` is called programmatically. Even if the call to `hide()` is delayed, the problem persists:\n\n``` js\n// window still disappears\nsetTimeout(function() { mainWindow.hide() }, 3000)\n```\n\nSwitching windows manually or invoking <kbd>Command</kbd><kbd>H</kbd> to hide the windoes does not cause any issues.\n"
