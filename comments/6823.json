    "body": "For capturing the window messages, you can find an example at `NativeWindowViews::PreHandleMSG`.\n\nBut hooking to `WM_PAINT` is just a very minor step to fully it, the pages are GPU accelerated and drew in another process, you have to make the painting works well with GPU acceleration while avoiding dragging down performance. After that you need to handle various mouse events and change the drawing accordingly, then translate the clicks into messages.\n\nI would consider this as super hard.\n\nA more practical way is to provide an API in JavaScript to return the painted bitmap of the buttons, and then handle the drawing and mouse events in web pages.\n"

This sprite could then be used to skin the controls inside the client area.\n"

    "body": "Hi! Very interesting project, I was struggling to obtain the same effect! There are so many options, but yours (re-directing the HTMENU area where you want, keeping the menus non-client stuff) seems the most promising. \r\nRegarding your last point: it's not that difficult, you can subclass the chromium wndproc and insert your message handlers. See what they are doing there (they left the menu where they are, but wrote a \"dark windows\" classes which can be applied to any hwnd, via subclassing: https://github.com/adobe/brackets-shell"
