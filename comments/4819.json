You could try setting `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` to the following.\n\n``` shell\n$ export ELECTRON_SYSROOT=/path/to/electron/vendor/debian_wheezy_amd64-sysroot\n$ export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$ELECTRON_SYSROOT/usr/lib/pkgconfig:$ELECTRON_SYSROOT/usr/share/pkgconfig\n```\n\nIf the glib-2.0.pc in sysroot got picked up everything should work fine. I am not sure why it doesnt even when `PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR` is specified. I will try to setup a slackware sometime in the next few days.\n"
