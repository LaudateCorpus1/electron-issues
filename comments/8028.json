    "body": "GitHub issues are for feature requests and bug reports, questions about using Electron should be directed to the [community](https://github.com/electron/electron#community) or to the [Slack Channel](http://atom-slack.herokuapp.com/).\n\nFWIW you appear to misunderstand the web-view API's.  `ipcRenderer.sendToHost` only works from **within** the webview.  I.e. from a preload script.\n\nGuest page normally refers to the web-view content itself\n"
