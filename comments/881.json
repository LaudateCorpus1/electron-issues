    "body": "Looks like the problem lies here:\n\nCode Example:\n\nmainWindow.on('closed', function() {\n    app.quit();\n}\n\nAfter we closed this mainWindow, if we call app.quit(), it will emit signals trying to close this mainWindow again. But this window is already closed. \n\nThis issue only occurs on Mac OS.\n\nSo app.quit() is a little bit dangerous.\nSuggest to attach it to only \"window-all-closed\" event.\n\nOr you may be able to update the logic of app.quit() on MAC? @zcbenz  \n"
