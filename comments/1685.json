    "body": "Hey Arcath,\n\nThis may or may not be related, but I've noticed that Electron crashes in some specific scenarios when you try to close a window from a window event handler in the parent process. (So for example if you were to listen for `blur` and then call `window.close` in the handler.) I believe there's a ticket about it somewhere, but it's easy to fix by waiting one tick before you close the window. Maybe try that and see if it works?\n"
