You can replicate that behavior by walking up the DOM tree until you find a match:\n\n``` coffee\nmatchedSelectors = selectors.filter (selector) ->\n  current = domNode\n  while current\n    if current.webkitMatchesSelector(selector)\n      return true\n    current = current.parentNode\n  return false\n```\n\nOf course you'd want to profile to see if this is faster than `$(selector).has(domNode)`, but I suspect it would be.\n"
