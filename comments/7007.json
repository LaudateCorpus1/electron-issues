    "body": "I can't speak for everyone, but reading through an **11 THOUSAND** line log file is not very fun.  For future reference you don't need to enable `silly` or `info` level logs.  The standard `error` level gives everything you need 99.99% of the time.\n\n**EDIT:** Original issue was updated with a more succinct version of the logs\n\nIn this case the key bit is\n\n``` bash\n13936 verbose stack Error: electron@1.3.4 postinstall: `node install.js`\n13936 verbose stack spawn ENOENT\n13936 verbose stack     at ChildProcess.<anonymous> (/usr/share/npm/lib/utils/spawn.js:17:16)\n13936 verbose stack     at emitTwo (events.js:87:13)\n13936 verbose stack     at ChildProcess.emit (events.js:172:7)\n13936 verbose stack     at maybeClose (internal/child_process.js:821:16)\n13936 verbose stack     at Process.ChildProcess._handle.onexit (internal/child_process.js:211:5)\n```\n\nWhich looks like a standard \"something went wrong when we installed this thing, please try again\" style NPM error.\n\nJust deleting your `node_modules` directory and rerunning `npm install` will fix issues like this 99% of the time.\n\nAlso issues to do with the `electron` and `electron-prebuilt` packages should probably be raised over at https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-prebuilt\n\nIssues to do with `electron-quick-start` should be raised over at https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start\n"
