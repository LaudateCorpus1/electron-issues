    "body": "First off, this is entirely expected behavior.  By enabling `nodeIntegration` you are injecting globals into this page including `module` and `require`.  Lot's of libraries, most notably jQuery use these globals to determine whether to inject itself into `window.$` or to export on `module.exports`.  This means that with `nodeIntegration` enabled these loaders act differently and to use jQuery you need to do `window.$ = require('jquery')`.\r\n\r\nBut really you shouldn't be doing this, enabled `nodeIntegration` while loading a remote site in a webview is a **really** unsafe thing to do, you're giving uncontrolled remote code complete un-restricted access to your users machine.  PLEASE don't do this üëç "
