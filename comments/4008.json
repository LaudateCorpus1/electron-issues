    "body": "Thanks for the response. Had a look at the webRequest API in the Session module but seems I can only cancel a request and redirect to another URL which breaks the websocket handshake.  I was looking to modify the url of the request before it was made which I thought was the function of the interceptor on Protocol, but I guess I was mistaken. \n\nI figured out another workaround in my project by overriding a function that builds up the websocket outside of electron so will close this if there is no actual issue. Thanks again!\n"
