I already have multiple web browsers on my system…\n\nThe point is that the desktop client has different capabilities to a web browser. It might be rather convenient for the application code to come from a web browser because then the end user does not need to download an update package each time the application code changes.  I'm just trying to understand what other well-known applications in the community are doing in this regard.\n\nMy main questions are:\n\nIf I update my application code, then presumably the end user needs to download an update, along with all the Electron binaries?\n\nDo Atom and Visual Studio Code load their application from the installed package files or from a web server?\n"

This tends to point towards applications architected like Atom, where the code for the application and all of its packages is installed and executed locally even if data is obtained via network connections. I'm sure there are situations where different trade-offs might well be useful. This is just the main focus of the current design.\n"
