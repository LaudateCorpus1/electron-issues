    "body": "@atdrago Sure have. I'm really trying to leverage native message boxes. Luckily, I have a great data management library with rollback support, so my current solution is actually to just delete the item and give the user a notification to \"undo\" it in the case of a mistaken removal. That may, ultimately, be a better workflow anyway... but I would still love to have a checkbox option since I think this is still applicable in many other scenarios.\n"
