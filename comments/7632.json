    "body": "It looks like this is a crash in usb-detection. \nI built electron in debug, attached to all the electron processes and caught the exception thrown in detection.cpp of usb-detection. It is happening in NotifyRemoved on line 87. \nhttps://github.com/MadLittleMods/node-usb-detection/blob/master/src/detection.cpp\nI haven't figured out why yet but I'll close this issue here and open one over there. \n"
