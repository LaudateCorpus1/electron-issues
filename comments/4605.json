    "body": "The `\\` is actually the correct path delimiter on Windows, though `/` also works sometimes it should not be used.\n\nThe problem in the original question is, the op was running the commands under MINGGW, which is a POSIX environment and doesn't support `\\` as path delimiter. I'm good adding a note under Troubleshooting, but we should not change the right commands.\n"
