This seems to just be the behavior of `xdg-open` because it also happens when I have it open an image.\n\nIf `xdg-open` launches an app then it remains running for the life of that app. If `xdg-open` is launching a new tab in an already running browser it exits once the tab is open.\n\nThe problem in this issue is that Electron assumes `xdg-open` will always be a quick launch and exit, so it waits for it to close to get the return code.\n"
