    "body": "Hey @astoilkov — I looked into this for our app. We do the same thing and users have noticed we don't support split view.\n\nUnfortunately, entering split screen mode is interactive—if you press and hold on the green \"fullscreen\" dot in the window, you enter a mode where you can drag the window to the left and right to choose which side it should land on. There does not seem to be a public API in Mac OS X to invoke this interaction manually. I think it'd need to be a new API in [NSWindow].(https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSWindow_Class/index.html#//apple_ref/occ/instp/NSWindow/preservesContentDuringLiveResize)\n"
