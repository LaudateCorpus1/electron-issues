    "body": "The official build of Electron requires support of `neon` instructions, but the machine on scaleway only seems to support `vfpv3`, which is quite old. The only way to solve this is to provide another build that uses `vfpv3` instead of `neon`, which I don't think we are going to do in near future.\n\nI'm merging this to #259.\n"
