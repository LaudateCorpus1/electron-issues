    "body": "The ability to run an electron app by passing an argument to electron is implemented in the `default_app` and not in electron it self (in [main.js](https://github.com/atom/electron/blob/master/atom/browser/default_app/main.js) follow the handling of `option.file`). It's meant to ease the development stage. For production, I reckon most apps don't want or need this behavior at least not as default. Keep in mind that in order to use the `default_app`, you can't have `app.asar` or `app` folder in your `resources` folder (any other name should be fine). If you really want to add this behavior for your app, I suggest you implement it in your app by following the `default_app` implementation (I wouldn't distribute the `default_app`, because it contains some other stuff I don't want in production, such as a global shortcut to open devtools).\n"
