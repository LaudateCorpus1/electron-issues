I've also tried running with frame/frameless, using a bunch of gpu related command line switches, and tweaking the code. All had no effect.\n\nI am pretty sure it's related to the Chromium update. The problem is I can't pinpoint exactly what the issue is. I'm trying to put together a barebones example that mimics what my app is doing, but so far it seems to run fine. The issue is only with my app and only on Windows. Very frustrating. I'll keep digging and see what I can find.\n\nDoes the console error give any clues?\n"

    "body": "@tejohnso Thanks for testing it out. The issue however is not with the cpu, but with dropped frames. The FPS display is just to show that it's not running at a consistent 60 FPS. If you run a timeline capture in the devtools you should see something like this:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/477975/16239037/f1bb3c78-3797-11e6-84f3-eec5fbf8e907.png)\n\nAll the red squares are long running frames (jank) causing it to drop below 60 FPS. If you look at the summary you can see that all the scripting, rendering, and painting combined is a tiny portion of the entire time, yet there are frame drops.\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/477975/16239201/a9cf5088-3798-11e6-88a9-09fba77e8086.png)\n\nOnce you remove the spinner completely, the timeline looks like this:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/477975/16239290/03979c2e-3799-11e6-83d9-4b1eee5b7bd1.png)\n\nAnd the summary looks similar to the previous one:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/477975/16239324/2bc25266-3799-11e6-8f37-466851cbb66f.png)\n\nIf you run the same example in Chrome 49 (Electron 1.0), it runs smoothly as well. I'm trying to see if this issue is present on other Windows builds or if it's just my system. But at least now I can consistently reproduce it.\n"
