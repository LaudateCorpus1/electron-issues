I was looking at the other events emitted by BrowserWindow (that are all dash-separated: https://github.com/atom/electron/blob/master/docs/api/browser-window.md#event-enter-full-screen).\n\nIdeally, we'd fire this event into the DOM but right now you'd need to listen to it and IPC it into the renderer process. I'm not sure there's an appropriate way to dispatch it into the renderer—what do you think @zcbenz? It would be nice to fire it via https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/dispatchEvent but I don't think it would capture / bubble to the element receiving `wheel` events without some serious hackery, since we're unable to really determine a target.\n"
