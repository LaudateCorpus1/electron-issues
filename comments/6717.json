Closing the window will trigger **app.window-all-closed** and process then exits.\n"

    "body": "> I replicated this behaviour in the Electron Quick start app here (https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start) by adding electron.dialog.showOpenDialog({}); after the window creation. If I quit (with cmd+q or the menu item), the app is hanging for a long time.\n\nHaving a little trouble reproducing this, I added `electron.dialog.showOpenDialog({})` at the end of the `createWindow` function but I'm not seeing the hang.\n- Does it happen every time for you?\n- Are you canceling the dialog or selecting a file?\n"
