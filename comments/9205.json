    "body": "@zcbenz the issue is not specific to file protocol, this will happen only for new windows opened without sandbox or nativeWindowOpen option, as we don't pass the referrer information from [AtomBrowserClient::CanCreateWindow](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/atom/browser/atom_browser_client.cc#L340) to our `guest_window_manager`. The fix is really simple, didn't get to it as I was working on other tasks. Can we reopen the issue ? Thanks!"
