    "body": ">  would it be possible to disclose Githubs level of sponsership or if Microsoft pay any employees to help out ?\n\nYes, we can definitely make it clearer that GitHub has full-time people dedicated to it and the other major companies involved.\n\n> Does Github pay for people to be permanently on Electron?\n\nYes, we have a dedicated Electron team here at GitHub will multiple people on it and are growing the team as well.\n\nThis is the job posting for it: https://jobs.lever.co/github/001fe993-4d40-4379-8517-0adf25a93ddd\n\n>  Is there any roadmap beyond 1.0 or once that is reached might Github stop that?\n\nThere isn't a firm post-1.0 roadmap yet but GitHub will be definitely be dedicated to the project post-1.0. The post-1.0 roadmap will become clearer over the next couple months and will be shared publicly.\n\n>  Or is this maintained by people in their own free time?\n\nThere are many great contributors outside of people working at GitHub, some contribute on behalf of their company since they are building Electron apps there and some contribute in their free time as well.\n\nHope this helps.\n"
