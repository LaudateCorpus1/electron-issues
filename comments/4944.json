It was mentioned that the spawned process eventually exits after 30 seconds but I'm not finding this.\r\n\r\n* Run \"electron.exe\"\r\n![threeprocesses](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15971213/23374864/e88038a8-fcda-11e6-89ff-902f5c05ae91.png)\r\n* Close the application\r\n* At this point, the command prompt hasn't returned.  \r\n![threeprocesses-still](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15971213/23374867/edf3cd5e-fcda-11e6-8f95-23783ef85b23.png)\r\n![stuckprocess](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15971213/23375003/8bec210a-fcdb-11e6-8b0a-cfda50ae05ae.png)\r\n\r\nWhat's interesting is that a couple of these processes are still active.  I just let them sit for well over five minutes and they didn't timeout and die as suggested by some of the comments.\r\n\r\nIt requires an additional Ctrl-C to close the three open processes.\r\n\r\n* npm version 3.10.10\r\n* Windows 7 Professional 64-bit\r\n* electron-v1.4.15-win32-x64.zip\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nBeen under-the-hood with this code for a bit and I've discovered a default `minimizeToTray: true,` in this project's **config.js** file and this was responsible in part for my own confusion.  Selecting the big X in the corner would minimize it to the System Tray rather than the expected behavior of exiting.\r\n\r\nToggling this then to `false` changes the results of the experiment.  The three program process all exit from Task Manager as expected and yet the command prompt still hangs in suspense, never timing out.\r\n\r\nUPDATE 2: \r\n\r\nI'm noticing that if I create a Desktop shortcut to the Electron.exe program, running it and then exiting, it's well-behaved.  All processes stop and there's no widow left behave.  I can see by Task Manager's process count that it nicely adds three and removes three each iteration.  So the failure-to-exit problem has something to do with the command shell."
