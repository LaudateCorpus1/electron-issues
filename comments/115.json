    "body": "The `python_26` which was built for win32 target is used to force `gyp` to run under win32 environment when the script is ran under Cygwin, so it's not needed when building under powershell. (Both atom-shell and node were built for win32 target, so `process.platform` would never be Cygwin).\n\nhttps://github.com/atom/atom-shell/commit/618d0c63973fc9e48c5815f1031533fa0a1b8dc4 should have fixed the error when bootstrapping under powershell, can you try if it works on your machine?\n"
