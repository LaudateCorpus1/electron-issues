    "body": "The Chromium's event mechanism seems to dislike how the devtools is detached (by moving the webview into a new Windows), in Chromium the detachment was implemented by creating a new browser window that shows the devtools. I haven't found the root cause yet, and implementing the detachment in Chromium's way is too time-costing, I'll disable the detachment of devtools for now.\n"
