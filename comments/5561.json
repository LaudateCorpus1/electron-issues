    "body": "Currently we're bumping version numbers with following rules:\n- for Electron API breakage, bump major version;\n- for major Chrome upgrades, minor Node upgrades, significant Electron changes, behavior changes, bump minor version;\n- for new features and bug fixes, bump patch version;\n\nSo no, we are not following semver in Electron for now. We only guarantee there is no API changes between major version bumps, but Chrome and Node.js updates can still introduce breaking changes.\n\nCurrently for nearly every release of Electron, we are adding lots of things. If we follow semver strictly, the version number of Electron would be something like 32.15.0. I don't think it is better than what we have now, from current version number of Electron you can know:\n- every patch version bump means bug fixes and new things, it is safe to upgrade;\n- minor version bumps are dangerous, your app is supposed to still work, but you have to check carefully for possible breaks;\n- major version bump means there are API changes of Electron, and you have to modify your app to run with it.\n\nI think the root problem is we are adding new too fast, and publishing new releases too frequently. The only time when a new release only includes fixes is when we back-port fixes to old versions, or hot-fixing the latest release, which rarely happens. So following semver becomes meaningless in our case.\n\nWe should probably document explicitly that we are not following semver, and people should always use fixed version number.\n"

    "body": "@jbenet Adding a number is a big deal. When in doubt, use community standards. Electron is built on Node and npm, electron-prebuilt is distributed via npm, so I think it's wise to go with the [established standards](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/semantic-versioning). A project with a `package.json` should respect the consequences of changing the version number w/r/t the default way that packages are added via `npm install --save`. Running `npm install electron-prebuilt --save` yields:\n\n```\n{\n  ...\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"electron-prebuilt\": \"^1.1.0\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe `^` has implications that rely on a project adhering to semantic versioning. Marketing concerns should not be the primary driver when responsibly versioning a software product that is used exclusively by node developers.\n"

For example, at some point Chrome enabled DirectWrite by default on Windows, which meant that a certain group of people with garbage video cards went from a working app to something that was a fuzzy blurry mess.  Or for example, Chromium flags can completely change from major version to major version and if you're relying on a certain behavior, you're broken. Or in M48ish, Flash was completely deprecated, even if you tried to enable it via flags - if your app was working before, now it's :fire: \n"

    "body": "Chrome upgrades are breaking changes, every time we upgrade Chrome version there are crashes and regressions, so if we follow semver it has to bump the major version. The same goes for Node upgrades, and probably toolchain upgrades (like from Visual Studio 2013 to 2015).\n\nThe problem with following semver is, we will not be able to distinguish Electron API changes from dependencies upgrades, all of them are bumping major versions. They are two different levels of changes, you have to modify your app for Electron API changes, while you can probably just do nothing to get Chrome upgrades.\n\nKeep current version scheme but bump minor version for new features, is nice but doesn't quite suit Electron's current situation. For most releases of Electron we are adding new features, so if we use this rule there will basically be no patch version bumps, and users will not be able to judge whether it is safe to upgrade Electron when there are minor version bumps. \n"

    "body": "If Chrome upgrades are potentially breaking changes I'd personally just bump the major version every time you upgrade Chrome in Electron. Node already follows semver so you only need to bump the major when node does. New API features are a minor bump and bug fixes a patch.\n- Pros: Easy for developers to identify breaking changes + a community standard + works with npm defaults\n- Cons: Potentially higher version numbers.\n\nI don't really understand why having a higher major version number is an issue personally.\n\nIf I want to figure if it is safe to upgrade to a new major version I'll read the CHANGELOG. I already do this for Node anyway.\n"

    "body": "I disagree that Chrome/Node updates should bump the major. The difference with breaking API changes is they can be planned. Chrome/Node breaking changes are not always planned and more of a side effect. And the goal of updating them is to not break things but fix/improve things in the upstream. They are also updated quite often. Bumping the major version often I feel would degrade the importance of the major number.\n\nExceptions could be made if the breaking changes made by Chrome/Node are major and planned. But making them control the major with every change goes against and breaks the versioning system rather than resolving it.\n"
