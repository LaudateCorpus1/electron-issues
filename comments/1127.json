    "body": "> The Chrome Browser is dropping NPAPI totally this year. Does this affect chromium and more specifically the webview tag?\n\nI believe it will affect us, but I think we can wait until they actually did it.\n\n> How do I install plugins for webview?\n\nYou can install the plugins into system's default location of NPAPI plugins, on Mac I believe it is `~/Library/Internet Plugins/`. Currently there is no way to add locations to search for plugins for `<webview>`.\n"
