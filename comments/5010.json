    "body": "The basic idea is, the name of API should match how you use them. So use CamelCase when it is a class, or mixedCase when you want to call its methods.\n- When the module itself is a class, like `BrowserWindow` => use CamelCase\n- When the module is a set of APIs, like `clipboard` => use mixedCase\n- When the API is a property of object, and it is complex enough to be in a separate chapter, like `win.webContents` => use mixedCase\n- For other non-module APIs, use natural titles, like `<webview> Tag` or `Process Object`.\n\nThis follows the style of Node's APIs. \n"
