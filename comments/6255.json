    "body": "Okay, I have some more details for this one. I'm programmatically adding webviews to my little browser setup. I was setting the \"disablewebsecurity\" using the \"prop\" function in jQuery. When I change that to \"attr\" everything works perfectly fine:\n\n`let view = $(\"<webview>\").prop (\"disablewebsecurity\", true);`\n\nchange to:\n\n`let view = $(\"<webview>\").attr (\"disablewebsecurity\", true);`\n\nand everything works fine. This wasn't a problem for the longest time, so not exactly sure what changed. Actually, if I had to guess I'd probably say it was the jQuery library. Before version 1.0.0 I was loading in jQuery (1.12) by setting the main window nodeIntegration to false and using a preload script. Then I could load it like a normal script. But then it became a requirement to have nodeintegration set to true if you wanted to use webviews so I had to change how I was loading in jQuery.\n\nI'm going to close the issue since it has a simple enough work around. Not sure if someone wants to look at it more or not but I'd say at this point it's a non-issue.\n"
