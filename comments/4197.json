    "body": "The autoUpdater libraries (https://github.com/Squirrel/Squirrel.Mac and https://github.com/Squirrel/Squirrel.Windows) used by Electron do not support passing state to new instance, I suggest reposting this to their repos and once they added support for this we can add corresponding APIs in Electron.\n\nAlso I think using a temporary file is not a bad idea though, many programs are using this pattern.\n"
