    "body": "Unfortunately this is not something we can fix, the names you saw in Sources panel are decided by how they are loaded. For modules that loaded from filesystem, they will be put under `(no domain)`, and the names showed there are their absolute paths. For Node's built-in modules, their filenames will show because they are loaded from memory instead of filesystem. We can't change because that's how Node's module system works.\n\nSome files of Atom are showed in `file://` because those files are loaded with script tag instead of `require`, and devtools does a good job categorizing them.\n\nThe only possible way to make things better, is to make devtools recognize file paths in the Sources panel.\n"
