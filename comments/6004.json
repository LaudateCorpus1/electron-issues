    "body": "The `minWidth`/`minHeight` only applies to users, if you sets a minimum size but then breaks it in your code, it is your own responsibility for what will happen.\n\nIn Electron the requests are passed to system directly, so you got different results because OS X and Window do not agree on how the window should resize. We can enforce the same behavior in Electron by doing an extra check, but 1) it is extra code and adds burden to maintenance, and 2) we should not pay for developer's fault. So I'm closing this as won't fix.\n"
