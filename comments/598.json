I don't even know if this should be considered a bug, or a feature request.\n\nI've been working with the video tag in electron, and it has not been what I expected. In my opinion if it's a video it should play. ffmpeg itself does support flv videos. I don't even know if there is a codec ffmpeg doesn't support. I'd go so far to say electron video tags should support all codecs that aren't hampered by licenses.\n\nIt would be great to do:\n\n``` html\n<video src=\"any_video.type\"></video>\n```\n\nI'm not affiliated with [playback](https://github.com/mafintosh/playback), but wide video support would help that project too. I hate to see great potential wasted because of limited media support.\n"
