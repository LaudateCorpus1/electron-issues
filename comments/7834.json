    "body": "I had the same issue, which I was already familiar with due to chrome and vs code having similar issues when run in a VirtualBox VM.  The fix was to add \"--disable-gpu\" to the command-line to force the web view not to use gpu features.  I was able to accomplish this in an electron app by editing the package.json file in app root and changing the line like \"start\": \"electron .\" to \"start\": \"electron . --disable-gpu\".  Hope this works for you too."
