    "body": "> Any ideas on how does this affect the performance ?\n\nI haven't done any performance analysis yet, at this stage I'd consider this more of an API proposal I guess.\n\n> Doesnt setting LOAD_IGNORE_LIMITS make request to be synchronous, wouldnt that be a negative effect ?\n\nI haven't tried that but ideally I'd want these connections to remain asynchronous, just without a limit of 6 connections per host.\n\n> As far as the http spec it doesnt seem to have upper thresholds on concurrent connections now.\n\nHm... Well I know that Chromium has it (hard coded?) at 6 today. I'm pretty sure most other browsers have a similar limit in place. But Electron isn't a browser, it's meant to be used as an application platform, right?\n\n> Any reason for this feature when SPDY or HTTP2.0 is there ?\n\nIn the case of older (potentially deprecated) APIs, there is basically no hope of being able to use SPDY or HTTP2. The Campfire API is a perfect example of this, and just happens to be my actual use-case here. But, SPDY and HTTP2 are both _extremely_ new technologies. I'd hate to tell developers with this use-case to have to wait for whatever host they want to use to roll that out first :\\\n"
