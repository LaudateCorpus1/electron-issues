    "body": "Thank you very much for the insight. I've looked through those programs for over an hour now, but unfortunately I am in over my head at the moment and haven't made a breakthrough.\n\nBasically browserstack-webdriver is Selenium, except modified to enable remote testing with Browserstack. I am wondering, do you know if Electron _can possibly_ work with this browserstack-webdriver package? Or is there a reason that Electron _definitely can not_ work with browserstack-webdriver?\n\n[This is the most basic example script that browserstack-webdriver provides](https://www.browserstack.com/automate/node#getting-started). It works immediately when we run it from the CLI, but fails with the _Uncaught SecurityError: An attempt was made to bypass the security policy of the user agent._ when we run the example script onclick of a button in the mainWindow of our Electron app.\n\nAny additional insight or advice would be appreciated. Thanks again!\n"
