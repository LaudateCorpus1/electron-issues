    "body": "Two questions:\n- From what I know `NativeImage` is not backwards compatible with `Buffer` so this would be a breaking change? Would the change for upgrading legacy code be as simple as calling `getBitmap` on image?\n- Are there any performance impacts from using `NativeImage`?\n\nMy current usage of `beginFrameSubscription` does all the image rendering in C on another thread. I do end up converting it to JPEG but this gives me fine control over optimizing that. I would likely end up calling `getBitmap` so I can continue this. However, I do see huge advantages to `NativeImage` since the work involved to even start using `beginFrameSubscription` is extremely difficult at the moment.\n"
