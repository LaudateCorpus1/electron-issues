If you are on v0.35+ and `require('electron').app` doesn't work double check you didn't accidentally install the `electron` module (which has nothing to do with Electron shell).\n\nBTW, questions should go to the [community](https://github.com/atom/electron#community), issues are for bugs/features.\n"
