    "body": "The scripts loaded by `require` are different from the ones loaded by `<script>` tag, Node did some modifications to them so the script loaded into page is not the same with the one on filesystem anymore. If we want to implement this we have to tell devtools which parts of the script are modified, and let it save to the original file without the modifications, which is not possible with the design of the workspace of devtools, so I'm closing this as won't fix.\n"
