I no longer get the Illegal Operation: 4 error now when running Electron Helper. \n\nHowever, I am still having a problem with the app crashing at the same place when loading and I've been able to trace it to : \n\nwindow.loadURL(url);  \n\nIf I remove that line the app does not crash, but obvious is useless because I can't load anything.  \n\nIf I remove the  com.apple.security.app-sandbox  key from parent.plist when signing the app it does not crash, but obviously I cannot submit to the app store.   \n\nI am now under the impression this is an entitlement / documentation issue.  It seems that Electron or Electron Helper needs a specific entitlement in the parent.plist that is not included in the documentation.\n\nAny insight would be appreciated.\n"
