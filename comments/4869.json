    "body": "Looks good, I tested two things:\n1. `electron-connect`, which was failing on electron `v0.37.2`\n2. Having two inputs: one of them uses a script's root-level-scope version of `window`, and `console.log`s it. The other one is a closure as follows:\n\n```\n(function() {\nconst window = remote.getCurrentWindow();\nconsole.log(window)\n}());\n```\n\nIdeally, if there was something wrong with the destructor, the closure would cause a GC every time that it finished executing, which would transitively delete the other pointer to `window`.\n\nFortunately, both cases succeeded. :+1:\n"
