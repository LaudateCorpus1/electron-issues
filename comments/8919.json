    "body": "> Is this the right behavior to delete what is downloaded from the bootstrap command ?\r\n\r\nYeah, `npm run clean` is a pretty comprehensive reset that will require a full re-bootstrap afterwards.\r\n\r\nWe could have two separate clean scripts, one to do a full clean when you want a full reset (often needed after a chrome upgrade or `node_modules` corruption) and a clean that just cleans the build folders so a `npm run build` will do a full recompile."
