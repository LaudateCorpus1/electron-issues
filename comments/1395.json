    "body": "I agree that there is a certain chance of collisions, but...\n\na) I believe there is a higher chance of accidentally overriding application-specific shortcuts with a global shortcut like `ctrl+alt+b` than with a windows-key-shortcut (even the [global-shortcut documentation](https://github.com/atom/atom-shell/blob/master/docs/api/global-shortcut.md) overrides `ctrl+x` globally in its example...)\n\nb) I don't believe atom-shell should enforce its beliefs about what good shortcut-combinations are and what not upon the developers and users (especially if users can choose shortcuts themselves - they should not be restricted in the way they want to customize their applications and can make their own informed decisions). This is even more true in terms of point a).\n\nc) Not sure, but I believe reserved windows-key-shortcuts can not be easily overwritten anyway, but have to be disabled first in the [registry](http://windowssecrets.com/forums/showthread.php/153042-Disable-some-hotkeys-in-Win-7-Home-Premium).\n"

    "body": "@zcbenz: Not wanting to install keyboard hooks is absolutely reasonable and I'd also argue against that. My intention was not to be able to override existing `win` shortcuts, but to be able to use the ones that are free (which including shortcuts with multiple modifiers are still a lot). \n\nConsidering shortcut collisions between applications may exist with and without the `win` key, I don't think the `win` key should be treated any different than `ctrl` or `alt`. Trying to register a global shortcut that already exists in the system should always throw an exception anyway (again: no matter whether `win` or not).\n\nIndependent of the state on Windows, Linux users should be able to use a meta key like the `win` key. \n\nHaving said all that, implementing the behaviour seems complicated at the moment anyway, as Chromium's [accelerators](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/codesearch#chromium/src/ui/base/accelerators/accelerator.h&sq=package:chromium&type=cs&rcl=1429443319&l=27) don't provide `win` key support and the `win` modifier is also not passed to Windows' [RegisterHotKey](https://msdn.microsoft.com/de-de/library/windows/desktop/ms646309%28v=vs.85%29.aspx) function from the [GlobalShortcutListener](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/codesearch#chromium/src/chrome/browser/extensions/global_shortcut_listener_win.cc&sq=package:chromium&type=cs&q=RegisterAcceleratorImpl&l=67)... Thus I guess Chromium would need to be updated first...\n"
