It might be too early to add it as a default, but eventually it be nice.\n\nAnd that is essentially what I'm saying as well. Enabling this by default is likely a bad idea unless the flag degrades gracefully. If this was a stable and baked feature on the Chromium side, it would not have a feature flag. @zcbenz and others might disagree with me, but I think it's irresponsible to add this by default since it will (in all likelihood) cause problems for users on GTK2 systems (MATE, LXDE, Xfce, etc) without making it dead-easy to opt-out of this.\n\nMaking this opt-in for the time being is the only sensible approach in my opinion.\n"
