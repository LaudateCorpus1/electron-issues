    "body": "Hello, sorry for coming up with this question again.\n\nI have tried to understand the current documentation at http://electron.atom.io/docs/ in order to find out, if Electron API can now read\n\neither\nmacOS Address Book Cards (vcards, vcf etc.)\nor\nvCards directly via CardDAV-Account / Server\n\nI need someone to develop an App for macOS that can access the phone-numbers from either local macOS or carddav-server/account. If Electron is still not providing this kind of access, I can still look for another Developer, no problem ;) But I would prefer Electron just because of better support for other platforms than macOS.\n\nThank you and kind regards,\nSascha\n"
