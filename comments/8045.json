From the docs about why `StartHandler` is only called from the main process:\r\n\r\n> Child processes do not need to call StartHandler() or be aware of Crashpad in any way. The Crashpad handler will receive crashes from child processes that have inherited it as their exception handler even after the process that called StartHandler() exits.\r\n\r\nhttps://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/third_party/crashpad/crashpad/client/crashpad_client.h?q=crashpad::CrashpadClient&sq=package:chromium&dr=Ss&l=59\r\n\r\nClosing this out.\r\n"
