    "body": "This one is interesting. When the option is set on the browser window the following function is called in native_window_views.cc. Because the window is not yet visible the second part of the IsVisible check is called. The following API call does not appear to work on Windows.\n\n``` cpp\nwindow_->native_widget_private()->ShowWithWindowState(ui::SHOW_STATE_FULLSCREEN);\n```\n\nFull function:\n\n``` cpp\nvoid NativeWindowViews::SetFullScreen(bool fullscreen) {\n  if (IsVisible())\n    window_->SetFullscreen(fullscreen);\n  else\n    window_->native_widget_private()->ShowWithWindowState(\n        ui::SHOW_STATE_FULLSCREEN);\n#if defined(OS_WIN)\n  // There is no native fullscreen state on Windows.\n  if (fullscreen)\n    NotifyWindowEnterFullScreen();\n  else\n    NotifyWindowLeaveFullScreen();\n#endif\n}\n```\n\nI found that if I commented out the IsVisible check and just allowed it to set fullscreen then it worked as expected.\n\n``` cpp\nvoid NativeWindowViews::SetFullScreen(bool fullscreen) {\n  //if (IsVisible())\n  window_->SetFullscreen(fullscreen);\n  //else\n  //  window_->native_widget_private()->ShowWithWindowState(\n  //      ui::SHOW_STATE_FULLSCREEN);\n#if defined(OS_WIN)\n  // There is no native fullscreen state on Windows.\n  if (fullscreen)\n    NotifyWindowEnterFullScreen();\n  else\n    NotifyWindowLeaveFullScreen();\n#endif\n}\n```\n\nSo that said I guess our princess is in the following castle:\n\n``` cpp\n// Do we need to call this?

This is also validated since you tried commenting this line of code and it worked well on Windows.\n\nSo, now in order to eliminate this bug, we can simply comment the lines of code as you mentioned and get the required behavior. However, have you tested the code after commenting out the mentioned lines with other operating systems. It could be required with other OS and commenting those lines might break their functionality. So, I think a better solution would be check whether the OS is Windows and perform the task accordingly like here:\n\n``` c++\nvoid NativeWindowViews::SetFullScreen(bool fullscreen) {\n#if defined(OS_WIN)\n  // There is no native fullscreen state on Windows.\n  window_->SetFullscreen(fullscreen);\n  if (fullscreen)\n    NotifyWindowEnterFullScreen();\n  else\n    NotifyWindowLeaveFullScreen();\n#else\n  if (IsVisible())\n    window_->SetFullscreen(fullscreen);\n  else\n    window_->native_widget_private()->ShowWithWindowState(\n        ui::SHOW_STATE_FULLSCREEN);\n#endif\n}\n```\n\nMaybe someone else from core team can shed some more light. Is there anyone who could confirm this and what do you think? @frankhale \n"
