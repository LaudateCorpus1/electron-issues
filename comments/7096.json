    "body": "@zcbenz I think the problem for this approach is that user still can open the dev-tools via the script or the other windows' dev-tools.\n\nIn our case, user can have many windows opened. And we have a window-list in main-process. User can use Main Window's dev-tools to access this window-list and finally get the webContents of the target window, then they can open the dev-tools by calling the API relative with it (`webContents.openDevtools()`).\n\n@minggo 's method prevent people doing these kinds of things and protect some specific window being hacked by other developer.\n"
