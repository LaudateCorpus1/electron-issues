    "body": "@romaincointepas Could you make a demo repo by cloning https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start ? That would help narrow down the test case. There are some operations in the renderer threads (the BrowserWindow) which make synchronous IPC calls to the main thread, and that can cause blocking in the main thread to block the renderer thread. We'd want to make sure that's not the culprit first."
