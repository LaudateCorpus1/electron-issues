Hope someone can reopen the issue :)\n\nHere is some of my test code:\n\n``` javascript\n        mainWin.on( 'devtools-focused', function ( event ) {\n            console.log('devtools-focused');\n        });\n        mainWin.on( 'devtools-opened', function ( event ) {\n            console.log('devtools-opened');\n        });\n        mainWin.on( 'focus', function ( event ) {\n            console.log('focus');\n        });\n```\n\nThe `focus` and `devtools-opened` event will be responed as they do, the `devtools-focused` missed.\n"
