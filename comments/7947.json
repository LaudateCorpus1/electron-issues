I looked at the Security tab and got:\n\n![screen shot 2016-11-11 at 1 13 38 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1270099/20227157/b3ddd462-a810-11e6-946f-a4dedb36575e.png)\n\nSo, for reference, I went back to my custom build of electron (in which I do have https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/7671 merged) and added `webFrame.registerURLSchemeAsPrivileged` to the demo. However, the devtools security tab still shows Insecure.\n\nSo, I'm wondering if even the current master, and my custom build, are missing a step for correctly registering a protocol as secure. Any thoughts?\n"
