I had to shift right click on the task and select move to move it back onto the screen. It also has a very small size and will need to be resized again. I'm not sure how/why it happens but it definitely does on some occasions.\n"

Now I know about Shift+Right click, which seems to be more consistent anyway. Thanks!\n\nFor those that come across this in the future, you have to use the arrow keys on the keyboard to attach the window to your cursor, then you can move it.\n"
