Like linking to a structure with the original suggesting would be\n\n``` markdown\n[Display](structures/Display)\n```\n\nWhereas the alternative would look like this\n\n``` markdown\n[Display](structures/common.md#display)\n```\n\nI'm also thinking about how these would be rendered on the `electron.atom.io` website.\n"
