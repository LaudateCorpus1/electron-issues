    "body": "Saying `true` is the default value doesn't make sense, because passing `false` to the attribute is actually the same with passing `true`, a more suitable way is to say \"when (not) added\" instead of \"true\"/\"false\". In the documentations of Chrome extensions API, \"if present\" and \"if on\" are also being used mixed.\n\nSo I'm closing this since it using wrong terms.\n"
