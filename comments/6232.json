    "body": "@kevinsawicki I was actually investigating how to implement the titleBarStyle: 'hidden' for OS X 10.9. In a native Cocoa app, with an NSWindow with NSBorderlessWindowMask, you can create the \"semaphore\" buttons using [NSWindow standardWindowButton:forStyleMask:] + some trickery instead of using 10.10+ titleVisibility property.\n\nIn Electron, as the NSBorderlessWindowMask is not being used, this could be implemented by just keeping the buttons visible and in correct position.\n"

    "body": "`NSBorderlessWindowMask` unfortunately has lots of unexpected behaviors, like not having a shadow like other normal windows, and not able to have rounded window corners. If we want to make the frameless window work like a normal window, it is not going to work.\n\nFor making `titleBarStyle: 'hidden'` work on OS X 10.9, I think it has already been supported with current implementation, we just need to remove the OS version check when reading the option.\n\nWe didn't turn it on for  OS X 10.9 because the original implementation relied on `NSFullSizeContentViewWindowMask`, which is 10.10 only, until recently #5557 was introduced.\n"
