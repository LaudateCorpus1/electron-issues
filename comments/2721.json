    "body": "Thanks for looking into it once you get the chance @zcbenz.\n\nJust to clarify the situation, I have something along the lines of:\n\n```\napp.setPath('appData', 'newAppData');\napp.setPath('userData', 'newAppData');\napp.setPath('cache',  'newAppData/GenCache');\napp.setPath('userCache',  'newAppData/UserCache'));\napp.setPath('temp',  'newAppData/temp'));\n```\n\nWhich creates the `newAppData` directory with the following folders:\n\n```\n newAppData/GenCache (created, but does not seem to be used)\n newAppData/UserCache (created, but does not seem to be used)\n newAppData/Cache (used by Electron instead of GenCache)\n newAppData/GPUCache (there is no option for such directory in app.getPath but it is pretty self explanatory)\n newAppData/temp (empty, but cannot really test if it is used by Electron)\n```\n\nThe rest of the `appData` files seem to be created correctly inside the `newAppData` directory (cookies, dev tool extensions, preferences, etc).\n\nExactly as described in https://github.com/atom/electron/issues/2668 the `%APPDATA%/productName` is still created, but no files are saved in that directory.\n\nHopefully this should make the issue more clear and help debugging.\n"
