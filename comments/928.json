    "body": "Atom Shell runs Node.js in both browser process and renderer process and there are some hacks to make Node's event loop work on each side, so making `--single-process` work in Atom Shell is not practical.\n\nAnd in Chromium `--single-process` is not supposed to be stable, it is only guaranteed to open the window without crash.\n\nTo debug a child process on Mac I think you can append `--renderer-startup-dialog` in command line when starting and then use [process attach](http://lldb.llvm.org/tutorial.html) command to attach to the child process.\n"
