    "body": "Would an app `activate`/`deactivate` event make more sense (currently there is only `activate-with-no-open-windows`)?\n\nI tend to think that window focus/blur should be triggered by the window and only the window. It's trivial to shim this and create your own event on the app instance if desired. There are lots of events on window that could be exposed on the app instance too but it seems like it could be a rabbit hole to do so.\n"

    "body": "Did we ever get app `activate` / `deactivate` events?  I see `activate` the [app docs](https://github.com/atom/electron/blob/master/docs/api/app.md), but it's only for OS X, and there is no `deactivate` event, as far as I can tell.\n\nSpecifically, I need to know when the _application_ itself is activated or deactivated, not at the window level.  Specifically, I need to hide all my `alwaysOnTop` windows on app deactivate, and show them again on app activate.  But I don't want to take any action if the user is just focusing / blurring windows within my app.\n\nThanks!\n"
