I understand if you don't want to do the work, but I would like to know if you'll consider pull requests for a feature or two like this.

    "body": "I know this issue is closed but I noticed that chromium's menus on windows are also owner drawn, they do not match any of the native windows menu styles.\n\nI'm no C++ guy yet but I dug around a bit out of curiosity and this file looks promising: [menu_bar.cc](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/atom/browser/ui/views/menu_bar.cc)\nOn line 53 and 54 is the following code:\n\n``` C++\n#if defined(OS_WIN)\n  background_color_ = color_utils::GetSysSkColor(COLOR_MENUBAR);\n```\n\nif I change `color_utils::GetSysSkColor(COLOR_MENUBAR);` to `SkColorSetARGB(255, 0, 0, 0);` the menubar becomes black, but the text stays black.\n\nIf I have any free time I'll keep on digging but if this turns out to be a useful clue for anyone else I'd be even happier :)\n"
