Windows is working.\n\nFor OSX. \nThe \"sharp\" is working in our build environment before I use install_name_tool to change the dylib reference path.\n\nAfter I patch(install_name_tools) all of the dylib that linked from sharp. Patch all of the related library path that external dylib. Use node to testing library is working. If I run sharp in the electron. I will get the crash when rendering. \n\nThis list is library that I patched.\nhttps://gist.github.com/topmat/b91a5714d88ac3d33d240a4f50e4adb7\n"
