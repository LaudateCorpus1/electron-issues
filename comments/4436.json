    "body": "> Can you submit Electron Apps via the Windows Store?\n\nNo\n\n>  Is there a way of getting access to these paltform specific features?\n\nMost Win10 APIs are available to desktop apps, you just have to call them via a native component or via edge.js (which is what the Slack app does). A few don't work such as Live Tiles or Cortana because they're rigged to send parameters through UWP's `App.OnActivated` event which doesn't exist in desktop apps, or require an AppX manifest\n"
