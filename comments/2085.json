I now understand that they're not and that any switches under [content](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/codesearch#chromium/src/content/) should also be available.\n\nI will start experimenting in `AtomRendererClient` with the code from `ChromeContentRendererClient::AddKeySystems` and see where I get to as this should be testable with the widevine plugin that is distributed with Chrome 43.\n"

    "body": "Yes, I've got playback working on a Mac in a _edited_ version of this [Electron branch](https://github.com/simongregory/electron/tree/widevine-cdm) with a custom patch to Brightray and using this [libchromiumcontent branch](https://github.com/simongregory/libchromiumcontent/tree/atom-with-widevine).\n\nThis was done by ignoring the Widevine related switches in [atom_content_client.cc](https://github.com/simongregory/electron/blob/widevine-cdm/atom/app/atom_content_client.cc#L163) to allow plugin to load directly (or rather be treated as Linux on a Mac).\n\nFor licensing reasons the Widevine plugin needs to loaded via the widevinecdmadapter.plugin so we are currently working towards integration of chromes component update mechanism. This affects only the Windows and Mac platform so I would expect the linux version to work as is (however I haven't checked).  \n\nBrightray is modified in Electrons `vendor/brightray/brightray.gyp`  by adding the following at line 122:\n\n```\n'<(libchromiumcontent_dir)/libcdm_renderer.a',\n'<(libchromiumcontent_dir)/libcomponent_updater.a',\n```\n"

For clarity I've [detailed the steps  I used to build electron and the upstream projects](https://gist.github.com/simongregory/0ece919708962c8432ac).\n\n@clebeaupin glad to hear it's working on Linux.\n\n@romaincointepas I'm working for the BBC on this, them adding extra funding via bountysource is unlikely but I've floated the idea. Good to hear that it's still working with the most recent changes from master.\n\n@massimopalmieri yes I've tested using the [Shaka reference player](https://shaka-player-demo.appspot.com/) and it worked both with the Widevine test manifests and some custom content I have access to.\n\nTo test playback I've been using the following in `main.js` (interesting that @romaincointepas has been successful using the `register-pepper-plugins` switch).\n\n```\n//You need to manually source the widevinecdmadapter.plugin and add to the dir below\nvar widevinePath = app.getPath('appData').concat('/YOUR-APP-NAME/WidevineCDM/widevinecdmadapter.plugin');\napp.commandLine.appendSwitch('widevine-cdm-path', widevinePath);\napp.commandLine.appendSwitch('widevine-cdm-version', '1.4.8.824');\n```\n\nAnd then one of the following in the html:\n\n`<webview id=\"netflix\" src=\"http://netflix.co.uk\" plugins></webview>`\n\n`<webview id=\"shaka\" src=\"https://shaka-player-demo.appspot.com/\" plugins disablewebsecurity>\n</webview>`\n"

I hadn't got around to building it on the other platforms.\n\nIf you've followed the above, and loaded the CDM via a standard 'register-pepper-plugins' then you won't have triggered the Key registration. To do this use 'widevine-cdm-path' ('widevine-cdm-version' is also needed but you can set it to anything from my testing).\n\nThat's detailed in the [using-widevine-cdm-plugin.md](https://github.com/atom/electron/blob/master/docs/tutorial/using-widevine-cdm-plugin.md) docs.\n"
