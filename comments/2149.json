    "body": "Still seeing this even though it doesn't repro on a clean WebView - it seems related to navigation? In the app, we use it in the login page, so we'll navigate a bunch, POST a form, then get redirected to a page whose contents is just `<html><script>window.close()</script></html>`. That `window.close()` doesn't end up firing either `close` or `closed`. I'm going to try to get a better unit test going\n"
