Should this be done for all operating systems or just Windows? I'm assuming you don't ever want an Atom-Shell app to display the Chrome blue window titlebar?\n\natom\\browser\\native_window_views.cc\n\n``` cpp\nNativeWindowViews::NativeWindowViews(content::WebContents* web_contents,\n                                     const mate::Dictionary& options)\n    : NativeWindow(web_contents, options),\n      window_(new views::Widget),\n      web_view_(inspectable_web_contents()->GetView()->GetView()),\n      menu_bar_autohide_(false),\n      menu_bar_visible_(false),\n      menu_bar_alt_pressed_(false),\n      keyboard_event_handler_(new views::UnhandledKeyboardEventHandler),\n      use_content_size_(false),\n      resizable_(true) {\n\n  // CODE OMITTED...\n\n  if(has_frame_) {\n    window_->set_frame_type(views::Widget::FrameType::FRAME_TYPE_FORCE_NATIVE);\n    window_->FrameTypeChanged();\n  }\n\n  window_->UpdateWindowIcon();\n  window_->CenterWindow(bounds.size());\n  Layout();\n}\n```\n\nIn addition to that on Windows the frame view was not being initialized unless AeroGlass is enabled. I think we can't assume that Aero Glass will be enabled especially if people are running Atom-Shell on a VM where it may not be possible to enable Aero Glass due to graphical limitations.\n\n``` cpp\nviews::NonClientFrameView* NativeWindowViews::CreateNonClientFrameView(\n    views::Widget* widget) {\n#if defined(OS_WIN)\n  //if (ui::win::IsAeroGlassEnabled()) {\n    WinFrameView* frame_view =  new WinFrameView;\n    frame_view->Init(this, widget);\n    return frame_view;\n  //}\n#elif defined(OS_LINUX)\n  // CODE OMITTED...\n#endif\n\n  return NULL;\n}\n```\n\nThis change doesn't seem to cause any ill effects on Windows 8.1 for me. \n"

I think we can't assume that Aero Glass will be enabled especially if people are running Atom-Shell on a VM where it may not be possible to enable Aero Glass due to graphical limitations.\n\nUsing `WinFrameView` without AeroGlass used to crash on older Chrome versions, if it doesn't crash anymore I think it is good to remove that condition.\n\nAnd pull requests are welcomed :)\n"
