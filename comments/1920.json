The only caveat is that you must have a shortcut in the Start Menu or else they don't show in Win8. Outlook does this for example. \n\n> Google's desktop notifications\n\nChrome's desktop notifications are actually custom-implemented and aren't in Electron (they're part of Chrome's notification system with the Bell in the tray and Google Now and stuff). \n\n> (e.g. Slack's notifications)\n\nSlack's notifications are actually custom code that are _none_ of these options above!
