One of the things that I would like to be able to do in conjunction with this, is to be able to rewrite the url for an iframe that is showing a pdf through my external pdf viewer, or even something like pdf.js.  I did find where I could rewrite the url for the session in the main application through the 'will-download' event, but there doesn't seem to be a way to do this for an embedded iframe/or frame of a frameset.  Am I missing something?\n\nThanks.\n"
