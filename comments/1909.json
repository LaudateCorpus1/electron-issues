Or using one chromium Download Manager plugin?\n\nBest regards\n\nSolved passing cookies to the main process from the renderer.\nBut i have found something else.... If in the main browserWindow from the dev tool i execute \"window.location.assign(urlToPdfFile)' the window show the pdf file after the download because the disposition is inline, but if i do the same thing through window.open or by the main process through opening another BrowserWindow the page is blank.\n"
