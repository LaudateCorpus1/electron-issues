    "body": "I don't believe there is a built in way in electron to handle this.  But I ended up doing some JS magic with JSON files to get localization into my app.\n\nFor strings used in JS we have https://github.com/MarshallOfSound/Google-Play-Music-Desktop-Player-UNOFFICIAL-/blob/master/src/_locales/_provider.js\n\nFor strings used in HTML we have https://github.com/MarshallOfSound/Google-Play-Music-Desktop-Player-UNOFFICIAL-/blob/master/src/inject/generic/translations.js\n\nThis allows us to do things like\n\n``` html\n<h4 is=\"translation-key-h4\">modal-confirmTray-title</h4>\n<span is=\"translation-key\">button-text-dont-tell-me-again</span>\n```\n\nAnd the appropriate translations are injected into the DOM.  Not sure if this is the kind of thing you are looking for, but it works well for us üëç \n"
