Just clone it and run it:\n\n```\n$ git clone https://github.com/jsayol/electron-openitem-test.git\n$ cd electron-openitem-test\n$ npm start\n```\n\nI ran some tests and, apparently, it doesn't always block. If the external app is already open before launching shell.openItem() then the script execution continues as normal. For example, opening the text file while my text editor (medit) is already open simply creates a new tab and electron goes on as expected, but it blocks if electron has to launch the text editor.\n\nI don't have any other system other than my Xubuntu to test this right now so It _might_ only happen on an XFCE dekstop, I don't know. Let me know if you can reproduce the problem with this example.\n"
