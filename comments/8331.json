    "body": "The expected behaviour you mentioned above is a chromium browser feature.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is a bit different in electron. If the filename exists, electron will overwrite it with new downloaded content, and this behaviour is intended (I think we should clarify it in `DownloadItem` document). From the API perspective, `getSavePath` should always return the path which is passed to `setSavePath`, otherwise it is wired for developers to see the result from `downloadItem.getSavePath()` is different than the save path they set to `downloadItem`.\r\n\r\nIf you want to align with chromium's behaviour, you can implement on your own (check whether the filename exists before setting save path)."
