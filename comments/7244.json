    "body": "Thanks @enlight. I've had a look at that lib and it works around this issue by checking if there's been a [number of unchecked words by the spellchecker](https://github.com/paulcbetts/electron-spellchecker/blob/7bda47a5395f599ebcb418a1f1348e9e97f16f68/src/spell-check-handler.js#L183), then uses that to infer if it should try to re-detect language and auto change the language from there.\n\nI was looking at getting more than one language spell checking at once though. Some users have been asking for suggestions in multiple languages as they quite often type bilingually \n"

    "body": "@Thomas101 I've never tested this, but I can't imagine that Chrome or even Microsoft Word does multilingual spell checking.  For one main reason I can think of.\n\nIf a word is valid in one language and invalid in another.  Is it an error?  The spell checker would have to contextually understand what language the block of test the word is in is written in.  And even then, quoting a different language would result in errors.\n\nSpell checking multiple languages at the same time will either result in an increase in false positives or ignoring real spelling mistakes.  I don't see how this could possible be implementing in a consistent and precise manner ðŸ˜¢ \n\n> Run the spellchecker over different character sets?\n\nThis however definitely seems to be some form of a bug ðŸ˜† \n"

    "body": "I agree it's a real edge case, but one that I think still has some validity. The approach I took was to setup a primary and secondary language. A correct spelling in either language falls out to a correct language and corrections can be provided for either.\n\nAfter digging through the source it looks like it falls through to `spellcheck_worditerator.cc` which calls `uscript_getCode` with the language code. This is translated into a character subset which is used for optimising the detection. There's a list of locales to language codes [here](https://opensource.apple.com/source/WebCore/WebCore-7601.3.8/platform/text/LocaleToScriptMappingDefault.cpp) so I can probably build a matrix of compatible languages using that :)\n\nCan anyone in the know confirm this?\n"
