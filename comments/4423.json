    "body": "@brenca thanks for the test case, Unfortunately html5 fullscreen api doesnt provide a good way to deny permission. The api expects a fullscreenerror event which is triggered under a few scenarios if the device doenst support or if the target element doesnt have the allowfullscreen attribute or if api is called without user gesture. The enterfullscreen call happens async after all these check, related [code](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/codesearch#chromium/src/third_party/WebKit/Source/core/dom/Fullscreen.cpp&cl=GROK&gsn=RequestType&rcl=1455596815&l=200). So with permission handler Electron can help deny the fullscreen animation but the api users will be under the assumption fullscreenchange has taken place as there isnt an error emitted. Any idea to fix this without patching chromium ? \n"

I'm using frame subscription for offscreen rendering, and at the current state of things, I can either deny everything fullscreen related by denying the permission request (and take this kinda buggy behaviour), or let the fullscreen thing happen, but then my hidden window will be shown and resized, which means a window that should be hidden is shown, and the buffer that I get suddenly grows, which causes problems for me, and I could not find any proper solution to this problem on my side (even if I instantly exit the fullscreen state and hide the window some bad frames will get through, and the window will show itself for a split second in the background).
