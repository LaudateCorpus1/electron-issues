    "body": "@zcbenz , After some deep investigation, the reason for increasing the binary size in v0.25.3 is caused by the commit 56afe4dd5d5c616e0b6a3d92f71ff93d20c19fa0. \nI verified that by adding that linking setting in v0.25.3 build, as a result, the binary is back to 61 MB. It looks a little strange, we might probably revert that commit. \n"

    "body": "> One of the possible reason between v0.25.3 and v0.25.2 is that v0.25.3 build combined the pdf and ppapi libraries in binary. However, after some investigation, I found it isnt the combined-pdf-and-ppapi reason, since in v0.25.3 the Enable Print API PR #1532 isn't merged. So it maybe caused by another reason. I will take a look on this.\n\nv0.25.3 has already been using the libchromiumcontent that contains PDF and PPAPI libraries, see https://github.com/atom/electron/commit/a6ba0cd10751c3b051503f6eea4b312c89f07abd. But anyway compiler should strip the unused code from final binary, so I agree this might not be the root cause.\n\n> @zcbenz , After some deep investigation, the reason for increasing the binary size in v0.25.3 is caused by the commit 56afe4d.\n\nI'm wondering if that flag has triggered dead code stripping of the compiler, have you tried it on the master branch? All the PDF and PPAPI code are being used now so I think it doesn't matter now.\n"
