    "body": "There was no changes to OS X's autoUpdater in 0.35.x and 0.36.x, it could be caused by other things. I suggest reporting this to https://github.com/Squirrel/Squirrel.Mac instead, which is the auto updating library used by Electron. I'm closing this since we are not able to solve this on our side. \n"
