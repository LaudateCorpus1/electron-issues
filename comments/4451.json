    "body": "This works for me, thanks! However, because it still calls the callback if there are pending frames, a JavaScript subscriber can still receive more frames after unsubscribing. Is that right/intended?\n\nAs a user reading the docs, I would probably expect to immediately stop receiving frames after calling `endFrameSubscription()`. If the current behavior is the one we want, it would be nice if I could receive a number of pending frames or some kind of helpful info either when I unsubscribe or as an argument to the subscriber callback.\n"
