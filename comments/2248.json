    "body": "I'm working on a Windows app that's affected by this issue. I've created a few test cases to confirm it.\n\nFirst I extracted a stock Windows app icon, to confirm it wasn't an issue with my .ico file. Then I baked in text detailing the resolution of each icon:\n\n![icon-app-screenshot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1204802/11526862/acd52546-98dd-11e5-8fa6-2d7d8a058b95.png)\n\nHere's the test icon file I created: https://cloudup.com/cO5RWp-v0Zp\n\nHere's the result in Windows 10 and Windows 7:\n\n![win10-tray](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1204802/11526908/fe6fa9e4-98dd-11e5-90d9-19b598c17fe1.png)\n\n![win7-tray](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1204802/11526912/016f1abc-98de-11e5-8655-7a4a9fb84fad.png)\n\nAs you can see, the 32px version is used even when the 16px version should be used. Scaling down the image to 16px results in a fair amount of artifacts, which explains why the tray icons look pixelated.\n\nTo further confirm it wasn't an issue with the icon itself, I created a shortcut to an app, and assigned my test icon as its icon:\n\n![custom-shortcut](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1204802/11526964/53527568-98de-11e5-9e6c-81a148483069.png)\n\nWhen viewed in a list view the 16px version is correctly used:\n\n![custom-shortcut-result](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1204802/11526971/5e5f8bd0-98de-11e5-9010-e04c843bdbfe.png)\n\nOne \"fix\" for this is to only include the 16px version in the .ico file itself. This results in the correct resolution being loaded, as it's the only density to load. But obviously this will result in blurry scaled icons on high density displays, or with text zoom enabled. \n\nThis could be an upstream issue, since Google Chrome seems to have a similar issue with packaged apps that run in the tray. Here's <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-hangouts/nckgahadagoaajjgafhacjanaoiihapd?hl=en\">Hangouts</a> running in the tray:\n\n![hangouts](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1204802/11527032/bc35ea38-98de-11e5-8aa7-219ac21cf4e0.png)\n\nNotice how the edges are badly artifacted, especially the right edge.\n\nEdit: I dug into the actual manifest.json file for the Hangouts packaged app file, and discovered that it lists a 19x19px icon for use in the tray, not a 16x16px version. So that explains the scaling issues in the Chrome extension. \n"
