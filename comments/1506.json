Although the cause is `NavigationEntry` returned null [here](https://github.com/atom/electron/blob/05ae1960d1e421cf057a960b0526890665983c47/atom/browser/api/atom_api_web_contents.cc#L261) .

    "body": "@deepak1556 It seems intermittent, it's not immediately on every link, but it seems basically guaranteed to happen after about 2-3mins or so. I don't have a repro example, my repro steps in the Slack Electron app are:\n1. Open the app\n2. Hit Cmd-Left Arrow by accident, which ends up refreshing the page\n3. Keep using the app, eventually click a link\n4. Kablooey\n"
