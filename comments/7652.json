You can't set them \"after the fact\" or change them\ndynamically.\n```\n\nThe important part of that is me saying \"you can't change them dynamically.\n\nAlso worth noting in the docs for WebView:\n\n> For security purposes, webview can only be used in BrowserWindows that have nodeIntegration enabled.  \n\n^^ Means if your BrowserWindow doesn't have `nodeIntegration` your webview can't either\n\n> Also, its more than just a warning its printed as an error.\n\nIt may be printed with `console.error`, but internally to React it is considered a warning.  Let's be real, if it was `console.warn` 99% of people would ignore it ðŸ˜† \n\n``` js\nwarning(\n  false,\n  'Unknown prop %s on <%s> tag. Remove this prop from the element.

If I get time at some point I might make a PoC but it definitely doesn't look simple ðŸ˜† \n\nAs a temporary workaround couldn't you just line up a preload script and say `window._require = require` and then restore it on your actual page inside the webview?\n"

    "body": "@MarshallOfSound yep, I suspected a preload script would be what I would need to use... Anyhow, if its not too much to ask, could I take a look at the relevant parts of the script? Also do you know of a way to pass variables into the script to replicate what I was trying to accomplish with the `sandboxed` prop? So say if that flag is on, don't inject the node globals, if its off, inject them. Anyhow, I appreciate the help.\n"
