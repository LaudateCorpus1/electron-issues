In order for a user to implement auto updates they will either have to:\n- Read the `Squirrel.Windows` docs and figure it out themselves\n- Read the `electron-winstaller` docs and implement that module\n- Use `electron-builder` which does everything for you\n\nThe first two use cases have their own documentation which explains how everything works.
