But I think that your second option \"provide an API to create a custom dialog with a progress bar in it.\" will be useful for many use cases...\n\nFor example, it would be nice to display a progress dialog when the app is searching for update, or when it wait for a connexion, ... All this stuff shows how useful could be this new API ;)\n"

Sure, you can roll with your own chrome using a renderer process, but the same goes for a progress bar: native progress dialog if it fits your needs (perhaps with some configuration options), roll with your own if it does not."
