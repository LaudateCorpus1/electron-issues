    "body": "Yeah with `UBUNTU_MENUPROXY=0`it works fine.\n\nAlthough, and you'll probably hate me for this: I've just discovered that on my other machine (ubuntu 12.04, both unity and gnome-shell installed) my `$UBUNTU_MENUPROXY` is always set to `libappmenu.so` even when I'm in gnome-shell with no global menu. Just digging around and I think it's set by appmenu-gtk3 package regardless of which desktop I'm actually using.\n\nMaybe I've got a slightly weird setup (I'm happy to override it myself, that's fine) or maybe the env var isn't reliable enough. I admit I know nothing about these things but [this page](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MenuBar#Advertising_the_presence_of_the_menu_bar) suggests `gtx_menu_proxy_get` might be a better way to detect global menu handler\n"

Or we can maybe check if `com.canonical.AppMenu.Registrar` bus is available.\n"
