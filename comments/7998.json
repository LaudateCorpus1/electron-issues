    "body": "I'll pitch in here.\r\n\r\n@MissCuriosity Angular is not aware of Electron's other windows. This is kind of like if you had Angular running in a webpage that opened a popup: would you expect that popup to have access to rootScope? (it does not.)\r\n\r\nI created an AngularJS project that uses multiple windows, and had to deal with this issue.. The best solution is to use the [IPC system](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/api/ipc-renderer.md). It works exactly like $broadcast and $on, except within Electron's ecosystem. You may be tempted to share the entire $rootScope through it, but in my experience, this makes your app unbearably slow. You'll have to narrow down the data you want to share between windows, and share only that. But this is a good starting point for you."
