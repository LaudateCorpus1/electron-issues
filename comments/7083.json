    "body": "@JohnnyCrazy Hi, you are not alone. I already opened an issue about this a while ago #1268 . I tried really hard to solve it but couldn't figure it out at the time. After a while it worked for me but I didn't do further tests because I stopped working on my project.\r\n\r\nNow I am starting a new project with electron, the issue is still there! I reproduce with this minimal test case:\r\n\r\n* Create a file `test.js` with the following:\r\n```javascript\r\nconst http = require(\"http\");\r\n\r\nconst url = \"http://atom.io\";\r\n\r\nhttp.request(url, function () {\r\n    console.log(\"END FIRST\");\r\n    http.request(url, function () {\r\n        console.log(\"END SECOND\");\r\n        process.exit();\r\n    }).end();\r\n}).end();\r\n```\r\n* Execute it with `node test.js`: works without any issue (prints both messages)\r\n* Execute it with `electron test.js`: the first message is printed, but the second request hangs. Note: this is not always the case, but usually I can reproduce after a few tries (`while true; do electron test.js; done`)\r\n\r\nIt seems to be ArchLinux related since I also use it. I'd love to know if you finally found a solution for this issue.\r\n\r\nElectron version: v1.4.7\r\nOperating system: ArchLinux, Linux 4.8.8-1-ARCH"

Because of that I didn't care if one request was failing/never responded, I just ignored the bug for my prototype. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nHowever, I think it's somehow really an issue with the event-loop: Often, the first requests returns when you start the second one. The second one only  returns if you start a third one and so on. But sadly I'm not a NodeJS-internals pro, so I have no idea where to look at all."
