    "body": "> Is there a way to register this global shortcut whilst still allowing the key presses to pass through to what app you are busy with?\r\n\r\nI don't think this is possible with the `globalShortcut` module, Electron registers and gets notified when the event happens but it cannot control if the key event still goes to the active application or not.\r\n\r\nClosing this out."
