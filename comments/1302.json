So in that demo (good thing positions are configurable), if you pass `x` and `y` with external display bounds, the new window is now created in external display so passing webcontents to `getActiveDisplay` will now return the external display you intended. This is no way the perfect solution, maybe if i can get position from dock or tray then i can let `getActiveDisplay` return the value you intended without this hack.. will look into it\n"

The screen with the Dock should have a mismatch between the two, even if the Dock is hidden since a few pixels are reserved for \"mouse-over detection\". Not entirely sure how this behaves if a screen has a fullscreen window though.\n"
