    "body": "I think this bug is linked to the asar file in which I bundled my app.\nI've tried to put directly the files of my app in `resources/default_app` folder of prebuilt binaries, and then I don't get the bug I described before.\n\nI don't know why, but try not bundle your app in asar file if you're concerned. Hope that will help\n"
