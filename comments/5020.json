    "body": "> Is there any way around this? Or any way for me to detect that proxy from within electron and tell the user they won't be able to get updates?\n\n@MarshallOfSound There are several NPM packages that let you detect a proxy. Or you could write your own solution in Node.js to detect a proxy. Could you do that without needing changes in Squirrel for Windows? Because there would be cases where someone would want to update via a proxy.\n\nIdeally I would skip all the above together and either check to see if the file could be reached and notify the user if not or attempt to download the file and notify the user if the download fails. This is how most updaters handle this.\n\nIf none of the above works for you I guess I don't completely understand your case.\n"

    "body": "So, the problem at the end of the day is, if you have an authenticated proxy on Windows, you need to pop UI to prompt for username/passwords at _the time of request_ (i.e. not just in a system settings dialog). This is deeply stupid, but it is what it is.\n\nTo mitigate this, you _could_ download RELEASES and the latest NuPkg file yourself with Chromium (as well as implement the login callback to actually show UI in-app), then point your updater URL to that temp folder. This is deeply obnoxious, but so are proxy servers. \n"
