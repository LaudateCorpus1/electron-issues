    "body": "@zcbenz  Chrome works without any tearing or glitches. Also Chromium portable. In both official Google products i can enable hardware acceleration without glitches.\n\nIn Brave with Electron it was usable until the Chromium 52/Electron upgrade and no glitch to see without hardware acceleration and now after the new Chromium/Electron version there are glitches also without hardware acceleration. Chromium 52 portable and the other versions available show now glitches at all.\n\n@bbondy since without hardware acceleration is the only way i can run Brave without any glitches, i have only software rendering/unavailable status in chrome://gpu\n\nAlso, that issue is happening on systems with an integrated graphics solution as it was also posted in the Brave github section, especially with Intel HD integrated graphics.\n\nAnyway, there was no problem without hardware acceleration until the last update, and glitches can be seen in general with hardware acceleration enabled.\n"
