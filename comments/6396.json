Windows will choose the 64x64 icon for >100% scaling which always look good for any scaling. For 100% scaling a regular 16x16 will look perfect but downscaling the 64x64 will makes it look jagged.\n\nI tested many variants until I found that this solution always works.

This isn't a very advanced editor but works for this test purpose.\n2. Create a 64x64 `.ico` of you image (for tray this size is enough). You can just drag n drop it in the editor and choose the size.\n3. Create a 16x16 icon in the current project by right clicking in the work area to the right (the editor will automatically create the downsized icon for you).\n4. Save as a new icon in `.ico` format.\n\nOne very important thing to remember is that if you switch from 100% scaling to 125% or vise versa you have to logout and login to get the actual result. The icon can look jagged until you have done this! My experience is that if you scale from 125% and above you don't have to do this.\n"
