We're tracking it with https://github.com/brave/browser-laptop/issues/6258\r\n\r\nThe problem happens:\r\n- with Chromium 54 (I believe we are using 54.0.2840.100)\r\n- when the frameless window is maximized (fullscreen is fine)\r\n\r\nOriginally, I only noticed this issue happening with DPI at 100% and fixed it here:\r\nhttps://github.com/brave/muon/pull/134/files\r\n\r\nThe fix works because the border was being added during `WM_NCCALCSIZE`.  I've updated the code since then with a better approach: listen for the `WM_NCCALCSIZE` and `WM_NCPAINT` events where `has_frame()` is false and set result as 0 and return true (prevent DefWindowProc from firing).\r\n\r\n```diff\r\ndiff --git a/atom/browser/native_window_views_win.cc b/atom/browser/native_window_views_win.cc\r\nindex bb6d985..3cf7c41 100644\r\n--- a/atom/browser/native_window_views_win.cc\r\n+++ b/atom/browser/native_window_views_win.cc\r\n@@ -130,6 +130,18 @@ bool NativeWindowViews::PreHandleMSG(\r\n       }\r\n       return false;\r\n     }\r\n+    /** Return zero (no-op) for non-client area events when window is frameless.\r\n+     *  \\see WM_NCPAINT - https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd145212(v=vs.85).aspx\r\n+     *  \\see WM_NCCALCSIZE - https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms632634(v=vs.85).aspx\r\n+     */\r\n+    case WM_NCPAINT:\r\n+    case WM_NCCALCSIZE: {\r\n+      if (!has_frame()) {\r\n+        *result = 0;\r\n+        return true;\r\n+      }\r\n+      return false;\r\n+    }\r\n     default:\r\n       return false;\r\n   }\r\n```\r\n\r\nEven with these fixes in place, borders are added (only during maximized; not fullscreen) when DPI is greater than 100%.  Something odd I noted (which didn't change- it was this way in Chromium 53) is that when processing the `WM_GETMINMAXINFO` event, the window will have a negative X/Y equal to what the frame should be (~7px) and the window will be wider/taller by 2x that value.  This appears to be intentional:\r\nhttps://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20120326-00/?p=8003\r\n\r\nI haven't found a solution (yet), but wanted to share some information while it's fresh :smile: "
