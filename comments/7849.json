It would be good if the options included `landscape: boolean` like in PDF generation.\r\n\r\nPerhaps if electron had an API for printing PDF's and then `webContents.print` could simply call `webContents.printToPdf` and pass the result to the PDF printer? Then the print/printToPdf options could all be the same and only 1 API would have to be maintained/tested? This would then support print-preview using PDF's and printing that output would be simpler."
