    "body": "It seems that node does not explicitly have named pipes, though you can use the net module's sockets: http://stackoverflow.com/a/18226566 . There also seems to be an easy to use third party package: https://www.npmjs.com/package/named-pipes .\n\nThat being said this is not the issue. Yes I could use a named pipe or a socket or a local file, but the problem is that the standard streams are not working as one would expect. I understand that this is not really Electron's doing and it is more a fault of Windows for not properly supporting standard streams on GUI applications, but there is a common workaround used in many other applications that could also be implemented here and documented to solve the issue and save devs the hassle of always setting up a totally different workflow for windows. Also imagine if I just want to do simple command redirection on the windows command line, I cannot create a named pipe there and it will just write directly to the console instead of to a file for example, which is confusing at best. The bottom line is I cannot use the standard streams which seems like missing functionality.\n\nThe fact that I call process.stdout.write or process.stderr.write on windows and it doesn't actually write anything to the streams I think is problematic enough that it deserves a fix. If you do not have the capacity to work on it then I will try and implement it myself when I have some time, but I think this issue should not be closed.\n"

    "body": "Yes I know you can set the environment variable to not attach to the console, and I think it is debatable whether it should be disabled by default with the current stdout behavior to avoid confusion. I wouldn't call reading from stdout as an \"uncommon use case\", especially since if I understand correctly Electron is supposed to be a generic cross platform UI framework for all types of applications. Many applications will want to interact with other processes, and if you want to communicate with other processes the standard streams are a very, well standard way to do so.\n\nI know that the project I linked uses named pipes, I mentioned it in my first post. I am not saying to avoid named pipes, they should be used. I am saying that between the options of all windows devs who want to interact with Electron having to set up named pipes in their projects vs Electron implementing it once and then the standard streams working for all devs, I think the latter option is better. Given that the standard streams are supported properly on the other main Electron platforms it only makes sense to support it on windows as well, yes it is a bit awkward on windows with the separate console executable and yes it will take a bit of extra code in Electron, but it will collectively save those using Electron much more code.\n\nIf the goal of Electron is to make cross platform UI development easy then I think the same standards should be kept across all platforms as much as possible, especially something as basic as accessing standard streams. If I can write \"process.stdout.write\" on mac and linux and it works then I should be able to assume that it will work on windows as well, I shouldn't have to write if (platform == \"win32\") and then set up a named pipe just because I am on windows.\n"
