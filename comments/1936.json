All of which is supported by node out of the box.\n\nSuch as XDG for linux: `xdg-screensaver suspend [window id]`\n\nLook for stderr output to see if it didn't take and do dbux instead:\n\n```\ndbus-send --session \\\n      --dest=org.gnome.ScreenSaver \\\n      --type=method_call \\\n      --print-reply \\\n      --reply-timeout=20000 \\\n      /org/gnome/ScreenSaver \\\n      org.gnome.ScreenSaver.Inhibit \\\n      [application name e.g. \"\"] \\\n      [reason e.g.\"playing a game\"] \\\n      [non-zero-random-integer e.g. 123]\n```\n\nOn Windows you can disable it on video start: `reg add “HKEY_CURRENT_USERControl PanelDesktop” /v ScreenSaveActive /t REG_SZ /d 0 /f`\n\nAnd then disable it on video end: `reg add “HKEY_CURRENT_USERControl PanelDesktop” /v ScreenSaveActive /t REG_SZ /d 1 /f`\n\nI am sure there are classier ways for the ones listed and even more ways for other platforms that might be out there. I found these with a quick Google search. A little bit of research/code you could rig all this into a node package with ease. Most native applications that need to inhibit screensavers do similar methods. So I don't see how doing it from a node module would not be a good approach.\n"

It inhibits the screensaver perfectly on every OS.\n\n@baconface this seems like a stable solution for Linux. As for Windows, what will happen if the app quits unexpectedly? Will the screensaver stay disabled forever?\n\nOn OS X, the two options are `pmset noidle` and modifying the plist. I don't know the side effects that both have.\n\nThis is doable, but as I said, platform specific and those solutions might have side effects. That's why I'd prefer a stable (as possible) solution, but if there's no easy way to expose this I guess a node.js module would be best.\n"
