    "body": "@zcbenz  I'm not sure if these are correlated but if you use `win.setMinimizable(false);` it actually runs RAF in the background but only if you minimize the window by using WindowsKey+D.  Obviously a weird / unintuitive solution but just thought I'd say something incase it might have ties within `disable-render-backgrounding`.\n\nBut, I can can confirm for 0.37.3 too. This feature / enhancement would be amazing. Especially for multiplayer games or app's that need to utilize RAF in the background.\n\nEdit: Added a request here at Chromium's Bit Bucket page: https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/cef/issues/1864/adding-requestanimationframe-to-disable\n"
