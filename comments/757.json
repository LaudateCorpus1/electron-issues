    "body": "Atom editor listens to the creation of other instances of self via named socket, so if you were copying [this file](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/src/browser/atom-application.coffee#L44), it may cause troubles.\n\nAnd you also need to change the application ID `Info.plist` in your application bundle, otherwise OS X would mistake your application for Atom editor.\n"
