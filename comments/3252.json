I am able to load the exact same pepper plugin .dll in Chrome Canary (49.0.2587.0) on the same pc so I think that the plugin .dll is okay.  Additionally, I have no troubles loading the plugin in Electron on OSX as a .so.  So, there does appear to be a Windows-specific problem here.\n\nNote that in order to get the plugin loading smoothly in Chrome Canary I had to open `chrome://plugins` while the app was running and check the `Always allowed to run` flag.  I don't know if that has any significance but I thought it was worth mentioning.\n\nThanks for any help you can provide!  And please let me know if it is better to open a new issue rather than to comment here (I wasn't sure).\n"
