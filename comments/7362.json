    "body": "@bsclifton @zcbenz I think this has broken mouse position inside a `webview` element.\n\nMy app currently has an issue where the mouse point would stutter all over the place in a webview (seemingly in multiple places at once)\n\nIf you read this issue thread from this comment down https://github.com/MarshallOfSound/Google-Play-Music-Desktop-Player-UNOFFICIAL-/issues/1777#issuecomment-258508372\n\nYou can see that users disabling display scaling fix the issue.  This PR seems to correspond with the version jump that caused the issue.  Any thoughts on whether this is the cause?\n"
