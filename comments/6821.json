    "body": "The APIs provided by macOS only allow us to set the titlebar in two styles, i.e. `hidden` and `hidden-inset`, I don't know a way to perfectly reposition the buttons to arbitrary place, and I'm closing this as won't fix since it is very difficult to implement and we will not work on this.\n\nBut it you have an idea on implement this, feel free to send a pull request and we would be happy to merge.\n"
