    "body": "OK so with these changes and the latest `electron-docs-linter` and `electron-definitelytyped` I managed to drop in the generated typings file to both VSCode and a personal project I've been working on and with a couple of tweaks (interface names and such) got both compiling with 0 type errors.\n\nThis is looking good to go üëç (I think, might have missed some optionals so please review / add them if I did)\n\n/cc @zeke \n"
