    "body": "Disabling `web-security` does allow accessing JavaScript contexts from iframes of other origins, but for setting cookie, the behavior is still disabled under sandboxed iframes. The errors you saw were from the iframes in the iframe of your page, which were out of your control and were sandboxed.\n\nSo web security was successfully disabled in your code, it was just that setting cookies across origins was still not allowed under sandboxed iframes, as far as I can see it doesn't hurt normal uses and only throws security exceptions in external pages that we have no control.\n"
