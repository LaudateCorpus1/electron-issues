    "body": "> Are there plans for these shortcuts to be supported by Electron's Global Shortcut Module ?\n\nCan't speak to that really, don't think anyone has plans at the moment :+1: \n\nAs for the actual implementation, I looked into this a long time ago and basically Apple make it very difficult to listen for those headphone button presses.  People normally use hacky workarounds like this https://github.com/Daij-Djan/DDHidLib\n\nIn fact I'm pretty sure that even apps like VLC and Spotify (which are built for native) don't integrate with those headphone buttons.  Community posts like [this one](https://community.spotify.com/t5/Live-Ideas/Support-for-the-headphone-play-pause-skip-buttons-Desktop/idi-p/78317) seem to confirm that.\n\nSomeone else might know some cool way of listening for these keys that I've never heard of, but I wouldn't hold any hope :cry: \n"
