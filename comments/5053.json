    "body": "I don't think you can. I believe Windows does this by design. Even [non Electron apps](https://github.com/MahApps/MahApps.Metro/issues/2066) will replicate this behavior. I would like to think a work around exists but I am unsure of one. The only thing I can find in the upstream is [this test](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/codesearch#chromium/src/chrome/browser/ui/cocoa/browser_window_controller_unittest.mm&q=39px&sq=package:chromium&type=cs&l=490). Yet nothing actually causing this behavior.\n"
