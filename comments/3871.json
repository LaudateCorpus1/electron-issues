May I ask if there be any thoughts on this?

It may be done with the following script:\n\n``` sh\n# May install the module with: npm install -g electron-osx-sign\nexport DEBUG=electron-osx-sign*\nelectron-osx-sign path/to/my.app\n```\n\nWorth noting that with `export DEBUG=electron-osx-sign*` you have view the full log during signing. Would you cross out some of your private info first and post them here?\n\nWe may just use the default entitlements to get the app running first after sandboxed I think if you don't have code at launch that accesses parts of the system which needs entitlement keys.\n"

I think, there is nothing that probably went wrong during your signing processes @Janneman84 @masonicboom.\n\nI've tried to remove the application group from the entitlements which of course lead to app hanging at startup (and this situation's why `ElectronTeamID` is introduced) but then the error log disappeared from Console. So probably the only reason for emission of `no application identifier provided...` is from this additional spec we made in the entitlements.\n\nSo far I haven't had too much thoughts about overcoming this but the application group approach is very welcome. I'll have you known where finding any info useful.\n"

    "body": "Hi I'm back with probably a partly-sure response which I'll start drafting tmrw.\n\nWhat I have learnt from researching, in some nice sentences, is the following:\n-  Apple's started to disable local tests of apps sent off to MAS submission some time ago; however, local tests may be done with development provisions (meaning limited devices registered with your UUIDs I think). It's like turning to be an iOS where you needs to have your iPhones/iPads registered before testing out from the simulators.\n- There are a few more entitlement keys to be added in order for the app to run, for both testing for development/production; however, once adding some required by MAS submission, your app will crash at start 😕 but that's fine to be submitted for review in a production release. (I'll figure out a better way to phrase this tmrw.)\n- There is an embedded provisioning profile `embedded.provisionprofile` that needs placing within your sealed app Contents folder for MAS review. (And this partly caused app resisting launching when testing locally for a production version.)\n- `taskgated` steps in when application group is set (from my observation) and it looks for provisioning profiles... Either from an embedded profile (like what iOS developers always work with) or an installed development profile (as in point 1).\n\nI know some of the words above don't make too much sense. However, these should only apply to situation where we use application groups I think. With earlier versions of Electron (<1.1.1), there's no need to worry too much as nothing just being said's really necessary.\n\nSome refs:\n- https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppStoreDistributionTutorial/LaunchingYourApponDevices/LaunchingYourApponDevices.html\n- https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/qa/qa1884/_index.html\n- https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/qa/qa1778/_index.html\n- https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/qa/qa1710/_index.html\n\nSorry but I've been loosing track of several other resources... The above are directly from Apple. Tbh, it'll be quite some fun working with MAS distribution from now.\n"

    "body": "@jpittner Thanks for trying out! There were quite some trials and errors lol. Following are some of my thoughts upon your console messages received:\n\n> 10-6-2016 6:47:20.069 PM taskgated-helper[78694]: validated embedded provisioning profile: file:///Users/jan/workspace/MyApp.app/Contents/embedded.provisionprofile\n> 10-6-2016 6:47:20.069 PM taskgated-helper[78694]: Found 1 provisioning profiles\n> 10-6-2016 6:47:20.069 PM taskgated-helper[78694]: allowing entitlement(s) for pid=78704 due to provisioning profile\n\nThe above I think represents that the settings with signings and provisioning profiles are set up correctly for development.\n\n> 10-6-2016 6:47:20.631 PM MyApp Helper[78706]: GVA info: preferred scaler idx 0\n\nThis just occurs from Helper naturally. 😕\n\n> 10-6-2016 6:47:20.662 PM sandboxd[3764]: ([78706]) MyApp Helper(78706) deny mach-lookup com.me.MyApp.rohitfork.78704\n> 10-6-2016 6:47:20.782 PM sandboxd[3764]: ([78707]) MyApp Helper(78707) deny mach-lookup com.me.MyApp.rohitfork.78704\n\nWould you have a check in your Info.plist and make sure that `ElectronTeamID` has been added, which follows `*******EKS` from what appeared to be from your provisioning profile:\n\n``` xml\n<key>com.apple.developer.team-identifier</key>\n<string>*******EKS</string>\n```\n\nPersonally I think this error has been fixed with an earlier update from Electron where application group is used. So probably the only cause of it should be from either `Info.plist` or the entitlements file, which in your case should already be set up properly.\n\n> 10-6-2016 6:47:21.463 PM MyApp[78704]: __net_helper_get_connection_block_invoke_3 could not connect to networkd\n> 10-6-2016 6:47:21.464 PM MyApp[78704]: __nw_path_evaluator_start_helper_connection_block_invoke net_helper_path_evaluation_start\n\nI'm not sure why Chromium starts complaining about the network connections (in case if you don't want access to remote servers). However, you may levitate this issue by adding an additional entitlements key: `com.apple.security.network.client` to allow connection to web server (or if there isn't one).\n\n---\n\nOn your note upon singing with `3rd Party Mac Developer Application`, the error should occur... This is said by Apple to be by design... I haven't had time to have this covered within my draft on the submission to MAS document. But yea, there isn't a possible way to test the real app which to be sent for review but using the `Mac Developer`, to abide by the Apple's modern updates.\n\nYet we sort of sneakily got around this by not setting application group!? I'm not yet sure if we may get around these excess steps which seem slightly unnecessary. However, in even a basic blank-screen app in Obj-C/Swift packaged from Xcode. The signing/test scheme follows in a same way. 😅 I don't really know what Apple's going for but the change slightly implies a paradox-like situation where test flights are to be available on Mac... lol.\n\nLet me know how it goes. \n"

However, with this entry added, the system may complain more by asking for provisioning profiles, which became the reason of my trying out those profiles with Electron.\n\nAlso, I'm not quite sure why errors about mach-lookups still persists 💭 if `ElectronTeamID`'s set properly in `Info.plist` and `com.apple.security.application-groups` is properly set in the entitlements file. However, we haven't open any PRs with respect to the document mentioned earlier as the current workflow doesn't really match the one from Apple. Previously we haven't distinguished development or distribution because the app runs even after sandbox for MAS submission... Not it appears that it should not.\n\nRef: https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/qa/qa1884/_index.html\n\n> Distribution builds of apps that use those technologies may be submitted to iTunes Connect for review, but until then, **aren’t allowed to run and are killed on launch**. This is because distribution provisioning profiles do not contain a list of hardware UUIDs that restrict the app to a specific set of devices. This is similar to iOS where distribution builds have never been allowed to run on a device.\n> Recently, the `com.apple.developer.team-identifier` entitlement was added to all new Mac provisioning profiles. This means that, **going forward, distribution builds of Mac apps cannot be run directly; they are for submitting to iTunes Connect for app review only**.\n> Instead, developers should adopt the Archive Build Workflow in [QA1778: How to reproduce bugs reported against Mac App Store submissions](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/qa/qa1778/_index.html) for testing the builds that they plan to submit for the Mac App Store. On Xcode 6, select Export as a Mac Application. You won't see any chance to select your development signing identity, but Xcode will export the app from the archive as it was signed at build time. So the result will be the same.\n\nPlease mind that some of the words there doesn't really apply to our situation as we don't interfere with Xcode during this part. sigh\n"

    "body": "Hi @tyv I would like to clarify the presence of the guide: It is written as a solution for error message `no application identifier provided, can't use provisioning profiles`. If your app eventually passes the review at Apple, it should be fine to run after downloaded from the Mac App Store.\n\nHere are a few cases and suggestions I have:\n1. If the guide (https://github.com/sethlu/electron-distribution-guide/blob/master/MacAppStoreDeployment.md) is used to create a Mac App Store Deployment app, the app should not run because it is intended for submission.\n2. If the guide (https://github.com/sethlu/electron-distribution-guide/blob/master/DevelopmentSignedApplication.md) is used to create a Development-signed Application, the app should not be submitted for review because we do not use 3rd party certs for signing here really.\n3. If only signing with 3rd party certs without following any part of the guide (https://github.com/sethlu/electron-distribution-guide), the app should be running at launch with an error `no application identifier provided, can't use provisioning profiles`. If it doesn't, there should be issues that need resolving somewhere.\n\nSo if we happen to be with the first case, there's no need to worry too much at the moment I believe. However, if to be with the last case and the app doesn't launch properly, we may need to adjust the app slightly... The error message could be ignored like what others did I think; it's not a big trouble to have it as far as I've heard.\n\nAs your app is currently under review, I suppose we may just wait before iTC says anything.\n"

    "body": "Hi @sielay,\n\n> Is there actually organised guide how to sign with using of electron-osx-sign that appreciate this issue?\n\nThe latest `electron-osx-sign` has not yet addressed provisioning profiles; however, after signing with the procedures (which could be done by `electron-osx-sign`) currently described in Electron docs, your app should launch and work as expected. Worth noting that there will be err messages like below thrown inside the Console.\n\n```\n7/5/16 17:47:39.451 lsd[476]: LaunchServices: Could not store lsd-identifiers file at /private/var/db/lsd/com.apple.lsdschemes.plist\n```\n\nAfter iTC submission, and eventually downloaded from the MAS, it is uncertain if this err log will disappear; iTC resigns your app for MAS distribution on Apple's server so those downloading your app could run it without Gatekeeper prompts.\n\n> Does it mean that, if my app needs to read files like ~/.aws/credentials it can't be in sanbdox, therefore it can't be in App Store?\n\nYour app may not access `~/.aws/credentials` for that the location is inaccessible without temporary exceptions in your entitlements file.\n\n> But trying\n> \n> ```\n> electron-osx-sign APP_PATH APP_PATH/Contents/Resources/app/node_modules/fsevents/build/Release/.node --mas --entitlements=\"com.apple.security.temporary-exception.files.home-relative-path.read-write\"\n> ```\n> \n> Gives\n> \n> ```\n> Sign failed.\n> Command failed: codesign --sign 3rd Party Mac Developer Application: lukasz Sielski (ZZZZZZZZZ) -fv --entitlements com.apple.security.temporary-exception.files.home-relative-path.read-write APP_PATH\n> com.apple.security.temporary-exception.files.home-relative-path.read-write: cannot read entitlement data\n> ```\n\nPlease create a custom entitlements file if wish to mark additional entitlement entries. I would recommend create `app.entitlements` or `app.plist`, which really is just the `parent.plist` mentioned in your post I think, with the following contents as a basis:\n\n``` plist\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n  <dict>\n    <key>com.apple.security.app-sandbox</key>\n    <true/>\n    <key>com.apple.security.temporary-exception.files.home-relative-path.read-write</key>\n    <array>\n      <string>/.aws/</string>\n    </array>\n  </dict>\n</plist>\n```\n\nThen you may sign your app bundle with the following command:\n\n``` sh\nelectron-osx-sign APP_PATH APP_PATH/Contents/Resources/app/node_modules/fsevents/build/Release/.node --entitlements=\"path/to/my.entitlements\"\n```\n\nFor `--entitlements` you may provide `app.entitlements` or `app.plist`, which is essentially your custom entitlements file. (Sorry but we cannot yet directly input entitlement entries to `electron-osx-sign` for processing.)\n\nAdditionally, to confirm your codesigning procedure being correct, you may turn on debugging for `electron-osx-sign` with:\n\n``` sh\nexport DEBUG=electron-osx-sign*\n```\n\nAnd then use `electron-osx-sign` to code sign your app bundle.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if there be any confusions. 😸 A next revision of `electron-osx-sign` may be more useable with easier customizations I think.\n"

(However, I don't know how @jpittner got around the video en/decoder issue... Or just following the conceptual signing flow at https://github.com/sethlu/electron-distribution-guide then everything just naturally resolved.)\n\nThe app should still launch with `no application identifier provided...` and without significant effects as far as I have heard 😕. So far I believe with your app correctly signed, the only signage is really only `deny network-bind`... Let me have a check for a resolution.\n"
