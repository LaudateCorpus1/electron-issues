That way, when someone looks at the document he/she will be able to figure out if it's outdated. If in doubt the user can go to the original and see when it was last edited. Something like:\n\n```\nLast updated: 2015-08-19\nRelease: v0.29.1\nOriginal: <link to the original English file - this is only relevant to translations>\nTranslations: <links to each translation of the file - this should appear only in the English file>\n```\n\nI also think that translations should be put in a separate folder per language (currently the Korean translations are just thrown together with the English files). Something like `translations/ko/`.\n\nWhen you search for something in the repository using GitHub and it's listed in the documentation, you will get duplicate matches from the translations (e.g. if you look for \"BrowserWindow\", every markdown file that mentions it appears twice, one for English and one for Korean). Maybe it's better if we move the translations to another repository. We can include the repository when building/developing using git submodules.\n"
