So that's  weird by its own, I would say.\nAnyway, this may be a TypeScript thing, I'll try without TypeScript and see. I woulnd't know if it being a TS thing means it should be posted on Electron or on Typescript issues page.\n"

    "body": "Well... It seems ONE way to do it, or maybe THE (only) way to do it (??) is to use `webpack`.\n\nI tried to have the react app (renderer part of electron) running in the browser. The need for webpack arose. Then I discovered it also solves my \"electron issue\" too.\n\nThis allows me to debug the .tsx & .ts files from the `webpack://` category.\n\nI'll close this now ðŸ˜„ !\n"
