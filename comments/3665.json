The answer mentioned that 46 will probably be skipped due to issues with their internal build servers. On some other issues Cheng said we'll probably jump to 47 (see https://github.com/atom/electron/issues/3312#issuecomment-153632338).\nSo there's no official ETA, but they are working towards it.\n"
