    "body": "@enlight Thanks for reply ! But what is the default behavior (1 or 2) ?\r\n\r\nAnd what if I want let the user select files and folders on compatible platform (with `['openFile', 'openDirectory']`) and provide a default behavior on others OS (in this case Windows and Linux)  ?\r\n\r\nIt will be more understandable to clearly write this in the doc and more better to let the developper chose this behavior. With an option to set a default dialogBox on unsupported platforms or by using the last item of the \"property\" array."
