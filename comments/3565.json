    "body": "I'm also hitting this bug.  Here's a [standalone test case](https://gist.github.com/rprichard/76697d6c47a3b265e444).  (Instructions are in the Electron BrowserWindow.)  v0.35.0 is good; v0.35.1 is bad.  It appears that when `showOpenDialog` is invoked remotely with a callback, it never returns, and then `window.setInterval` callbacks stop firing.  Calling `showOpenDialog` from the main process instead works fine.\n\nEdit: I've tested my code on OS X, Linux, and Windows.  On all of them, v0.35.1 is broken, but 0.35.0 works.\n"

    "body": "Also, it's possible for the `showOpenDialog` call to hang still, even with my fix.  There's no guarantee that the callback function that `callFunction` appends to the call arguments will actually be called, and if it isn't, then `event.returnValue` is never set.  e.g. extra arguments:\n\n```\nDialog.showOpenDialog(null, {title: 'TEST'}, function() {}, \"dummy\");\n```\n\nIt's not immediately obvious to me how to prevent this from happening.  Better argument validation somewhere, I'd guess.\n"
