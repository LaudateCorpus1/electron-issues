Was hoping to PR this after 54 upgrade.\n\n> Could you elaborate on this a little more? Are there downsides to using the agent from node?\n\nNo downside, just I am not sure what would be followed once we have a build that contains `v8_inspector` as part of `v8`. Will we make api changes in node as patch or will we write our own inspector agent to avoid it ?\n"

    "body": "Hey @michaelprescott! The issue noted here is actually a feature request for Node's new `--inspect` flag (which allows third party debuggers, like VSCode, to connect to a node process via a nicer API.) You don't need this new flag to use the existing debugging approaches in the docs. For the renderer process, you should definitely be using the Chrome Developer Tools. For the main process, my personal favorite is using node-inspector, but there are a couple different options documented here:  https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/tutorial/debugging-main-process-node-inspector.md. Hope that helps!"
