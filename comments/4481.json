    "body": "Isn't that by the design of the webview? That it can't interface and manipulate directly with the parent? And that it is it's own process outside of your application? You need to [send an IPC message to the parent with an instruction or event handle](https://github.com/atom/electron/blob/master/docs/api/web-view-tag.md#event-ipc-message) and then have the parent be the interpreter and manipulate itself based on that instruction. IE, the IPC message is doSomething and your capture in the parent calls a function doSomething() with or without arguments sent with the IPC.\n"

    "body": "I definitely want a webview in its own process and im fine with no _direct_ manipulation of parent. I want the main thread to be able to work out what window a webview message is coming from.\n\nWhen you send an ipc message from the webview, it goes to the main process, not the parent webview.. How do you send a message to the parent? I assume its postMessage on opener ?\n\nBtw that link you provided is just to the webview documentation, where i cant see a mention pf parent.\n"
