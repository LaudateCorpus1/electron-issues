    "body": "You may view all chrome switches in https://code.google.com/p/chromium/codesearch#chromium/src/content/public/common/content_switches.cc. However, electron doesn't guarantee all the switches make sense since it's hard to test all these switches. The switches listed in electron's document are well tested and meet most of user requirements.\n\nI think you can try the switch you needed, and see whether it works. If it won't, report back to the community.\n"
