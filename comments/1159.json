(**Edit:** or \"web page\", I guess the docs aren't as clear about that as I remembered)\nYeah, those names can definitely get confusing (although they do make sense). If we had better distinguishable (new) names and a majority of people we're using those it would be good.\nBut currently I'll stick to the official names (from the docs), this way it is defined what you meant and not open to interpretation what the \"browser\" is.\n~~**Edit:** I personally feel calling the browser-side \"main.js\" is more confusing. (But I think with a nw-background this would make more sense...)~~\n\nSorry for going off-topic on this...\n\n**Edit:** Oh yeah, sorry - the actual explanation. Correct me if I'm wrong, but AFAIK it's\nbrowser-side - this is what your actual Chromium/Firefox/etc _Browser_ would be doing: creating windows, etc\nrenderer-side / web page - this is your typical \"client-side\" web-experience. If you want to do anything fancy, you have to call out to the browser-side (via `ipc` or `remote`).\nSee also https://github.com/atom/atom-shell/blob/master/docs/tutorial/quick-start.md#the-browser-side\n"
