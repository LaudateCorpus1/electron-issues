    "body": "@MarshallOfSound @enlight Thanks for the info.\r\n\r\nNot sure if you guys are on the electron team but in case you are: IMO, it should be stated in the docs that using background windows, despite being recommended by various old articles, is not a best practice. Many man-hours could be saved! This is especially the case since, as far as I know, there is no discussion about concurrency and it becomes an issue when building \"non-trivial\" electron apps for production as the main thread and renderer processes can be completely blocked, and there exist, e.g. in Cocoa, official patterns and abstractions for doing concurrent operations such as GCD, NSOperationQueues, threads, etc."
