    "body": "Currently Mac's breakpad symbols were dumped from the binaries directly, so we could only get stack traces with mangled (or no) function names, just like the plain text ones we got before. I tried to dump symbols from the `.dSYM` files, but the stack traces were strangely truncated, then I found https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=304846, according to which it was related to the clang version used for compiling atom-shell and libchromiumcontent. :(\n"

    "body": "So I debugged into `dump_syms` and found that when using the symbols dumped from `.dSYM`s, the stack frame's EIP would be pointed to wrong addresses, which made `minidump_stackwalk` thought it was an wrong stack trace and truncated it. After deeper digging I found that this only happens when CFI is used, which led me to this bug: https://code.google.com/p/google-breakpad/issues/detail?id=443&can=1&q=cfi. Finally I passed `-c` (Do not generate CFI section) to `dump_syms` and the stack trace truncation was gone.\n"
