It is  C:\\Users...\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm\\electron.cmd for some reasons try to execute run.bat with /bin/bash.exe which is not present on my computer in that folder (I do not have bash in PATH at all). \n\nWorkaround for me was to replace /bin/bash with just cmd.exe in electron.cmd and it works as expected. \n\nLooks like PR you referring fixes this issue.\n"
