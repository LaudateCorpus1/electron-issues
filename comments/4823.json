    "body": "There's a difference between what you can see in Explorer.exe and Node' native fs library - just because it's in the Explorer, it sadly doesn't mean that native tools can talk to it like it's on the filesystem. That sucks, but that's sadly the case.\n\nGiven that `fs` can't read or write to `smb://`, I'm not sure that there's anything useful we can do here. If you have a usecase in which your users _have_ to run from samba, use tools like Squirrel to first copy your whole Electron app to the user's app data folder - that should solve the issue.\n"
