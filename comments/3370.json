At the end, I want to make our software accessible to people who can't afford windows 7+ only.\n\nI pretty much guess that I don't need to tell you:  I am against telling people to upgrade (can you?) to something worst when the actual hardware and system is still working well. And security isn't always an issue, my 3k laptop from Sony (2006) is doing just fine, with the the same xp installation and never had any security problem or virus, because you know: there are also people who don't install crap on their beloved machines and take care. On the contrary: do you image how much trash & waste we'd have more if everybody would follow the wasteful practices dictated by software developers (supposed to have the bigger image on mind, lol) or hardware manufacturers (not expecting anything)? You want me to trash 6k of great hardware now? Just some little sunday thoughts of somebody who's shocked what's going on regarding the matter.\n\nI came along other manufacturers with windows-xp issues these days, only the guys from Mongo-DB didn't tell me any of the usual security & MS$ tales and they fixed their stuff on the same day (they responded in less than 10 minutes on that). That's just great and makes me proud :-)\ng\n"

    "body": "Ok, gonna try NW and CEF now too. I don't mind how many users sit on xp, stats say 10% share but I am sure that the non-western world has their own numbers. I expect much larger numbers there. You can't really switch to LUbuntu or similar when there are just no hardware drivers, especially laptops from 2004 - 2010. You could try but we know how hard it is to get linux running on non supported hardware.  I also expect the same long tail of IE-6/8 for windows-xp. \n\nthanks for the heads up and suggestions, very much appreciated. \n"
