    "body": "> Question 1: Can this setProxy be used multiple times after the session has \"started\"?\n\nYes, calling `setproxy` will reset the proxy service with the config provided.\n\n> Question 2: Could a proxy (config or PAC URL) be specified for a webview and not the entire Browser window?\n\nYes, you can use the partition attribute of `webview` to isolate its request context from the browser window and use `setProxy` as usual.\n"

Any plan for adding access to the webview webContents from outside that webview?\n\nThe idea here is that I'm trying to set the proxy before loading a specific URL into the webview (I'm loading a remote website that needs to be proxied). I'm not sure how to achieve that (as the `preload` script will be executed after the webview URL has been fetched).\n\nRight now the only solution would be to load a dummy blank page, the script in `preload` would execute and change the proxy settings, then I would load the real URL.\n\nDo you see a better way to achieve this?\n\nThanks!\n"
