Was just testing the original issue in #8209 and I was only able to reproduce it on macOS, it seemed to work correctly on Windows and Linux since the window is focused before the menu shows.\r\n\r\nIf we only need to fix it on macOS, there might be a simpler way due to the menu implementation on macOS.\r\n\r\nWas curious to know if you saw it occur on other platforms or only on macOS? Thanks."
