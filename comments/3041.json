    "body": "I don't think that performance is really an issue for the majority of applications that might need source code protection. From a quick look at nw.js issues, it doesn't seem that most users of this feature are complaining about the performance, so I guess it's good enough.\nThe feature should be configurable so it won't hurt the performance of regular applications.\n\nMany companies that create paid applications for corporate or consumers want source code protection so they can protect their IP. Some might even be obligated to do that according to their contracts. For them, Electron is a non-starter. So by not offering this feature we're limiting our user base.\nI'm aware that they can protect the sensitive code in a native addon, but I think most of our users choose to use Electron, because they want to write applications using web technologies and not mess around with low level C++.\n\nIs there some other way we can offer source code protection in Electron? Maybe we can offer some build script that will block devtools and remote debugging. The script can also encrypt each file in app.asar (but we'll need a safe way to store the decryption password in the code).\n\n@zcbenz, can you reconsider?\n"

    "body": "> This should be easy to do, just don't add a menu item for it, no?\n\nI think it's more complicated than that, since we support Chromium's command line arguments. So even if we don't include a devtools shortcut, you can still pass the `--remote-debugging-port=8315` and access the decrypted source through `http://localhost:8315`.\n\n> Snapshots are generated by V8, which means its format is documented - this isn't \"protection\".\n\nFrom what I understand, this is not the case. The snapshot is made by running the code through v8 and then taking a snapshot of the heap (reversing that is pretty much like reversing native code). The \"problem\" is that it also saves the source code in the snapshot so it can do some optimizations during the run. What nw.js and EncloseJS apparently do is to remove that source code and make sure that v8 is ok with that.\n\n> web technology is just not an appropriate software choice if you need to give your software to customers but ensure they never read it.\n\nWeb technologies were also considered not appropriate for making desktop apps (Electron, nw.js, Chrome apps), server side apps (Node.js), mobile apps (Cordova, React native)  and IoT (IoT.js), but people are still using it for that. The amount of innovation that is happening with web technologies is unparalleled, so naturally, makers of propriety applications don't want to be left behind and are interested in using them.\nIt would have been one thing if no one has done it before, and then we could of said, \"well we don't even know if it's possible...\", but that's not the case.\nWe can either find some way to support it, or tell folks: \"Use nw.js instead\". I think it's better to see if we can support it (one way or another). I want more enterprise developers to use it, because it would strengthen the community (bug fixes, popularity etc.).\n"

The only problems I saw with EVB in the past was some false positives from certain anti-virus apps (only happened when extracting dlls to tmp, but you can instruct it not to do that) and when trying to hook the output executable using some ancient methods.\nUsing EVB does hurt performance on process startup, but usually it's barely noticeable.\n"

    "body": "> apparently all major users of Electron don't have needs for that.  \n\nThat's not really a good metric? You could have other potential major users of Electron, yet they didn't adopt Electron due to the lack of source code protection. Sorta like a burger joint saying all their customers are happy eating meat burgers and don't have interest in burgers for vegans, so that market is completely ignored, the vegans might have happily became customers to the burger joint if they were catered for, instead of voicing interest in vegan burgers they find a burger joint that caters to vegans instead.\n\nI've had an enterprise client for a project in the past but the lack of source protection with Electron put them off it, which is unfortunate since I quite like Electron :(\n"

I think the reality is far closer to \"all major users... are trying to find an answer for this, but have stopped asking because they see it's not a priority for the dev team\". It's perhaps the only reason why anyone would pick `nw.js` over Electron at this point (my opinion, anyhow).\n\nI realize this is a free and open-source project, but let's not pretend that security isn't something everyone should care about. Whether-or-not the source code is proprietary is irrelevant, security should be a priority.\n\nWe have looked at tools like enclose, jxcore and others extensively -- and one of my major beefs right now is that while they \"work\" inside Electron, I can't wrap the runtime node modules (e.g. `browser-window`) into the snapshot/build/whatever-you-call-them.\n\n> On Electron's side we don't want to sacrifice performance for source code protection\n\nI don't think anyone is asking Electron to sacrifice performance, but that's a trade-off many of us are willing to make on our own code. Even in `nw.js` the \"snapshot\" isn't (always) the entire project -- it's a subset of the JS code chosen by the developer.\n\n> I'm also :-1: on this feature, web technology is just not an appropriate software choice if you need to give your software to customers but ensure they never read it. Snapshots are generated by V8, which means its format is documented - this isn't \"protection\".\n\nCombined with the existing `.asar` format, `uglify` and other methods of \"security through frustration\" would give most companies the satisfaction of saying \"our code isn't in clear text files\". It may not be encrypted and safe from NSA snooping, but I don't think that is an expectation anyone has (or at least me).\n\nCase and point: `nw.js` is \"good enough\" for most people, even though I'm sure it's \"security\" is far from robust.\n\n---\n\nYou guys are killing things with Electron! This project is amazing, and we really appreciate the work you are putting into it -- but I really think it's misguided to dismiss this option as something people don't want.\n"

Implementing this particular feature would be time consuming for the Electron team, and (in your opinion) not worth the cost of development/maintenance\n3. Any company who needs such source-code protection ought to be able to afford another solution\n\nI am willing to concede the first point, though I still believe it's \"good enough\" for the vast majority of people interested in Electron. As far as I can tell, this is about the only relevant difference between Electron and nw.js -- and while your goal shouldn't necessarily be to implement every feature of your competitor, it is an obvious bullet point on the list of pros/cons for everyone interested in such a product.\n\nOn the second point, perhaps you're right that the Electron team should not have to bear this cost. Maybe V8 snapshots are the wrong solution for the reasons you mention -- but is that simply the end of this conversation? As far as I can tell there isn't a public roadmap for Electron, so if there are other features (more awesome, more important, whatever) I am very curious why the question of \"source code protection\" (deliberately not using the word \"security\") gets brushed aside so quickly.\n\nOn the third point, you're absolutely right. Companies using Electron, or any OSS product, need to bear significant costs to protect their source code. I'm not suggesting that Electron be the set-it-and-forget-it solution, but the you've already committed to the `.asar` format which (at least on the surface) seems like halfway to agreeing with the need to lock-down parts of the runtime/source code.\n\nI realize that we can agree to disagree, but the three points you brought up (assuming I've summarized them accurately) are **very** different from saying \"all major users... don't have needs for that\". In my case, we have gone to significant lengths to customize Electron modules (among other things) for our own protection. I am sure that others have as well.\n\nIf it isn't already obvious, I think Electron is far and away a better solution than nw.js. Maybe it isn't your goal to crush the competition, but this issue is a sticking point for a lot of people who would otherwise be using Electron (even if it's because of flawed logic).\n"

If it takes a couple of days, to me it seems like a no brainer and we should just do it. If it takes weeks then it should wait in the backlog.\n\nCurrently the code is completely in the clear. You don't need any knowledge in reversing to take an Electron app, insert some malicious code and redistribute it. The ease of it, is disturbing. \nEdit: Some could argue that that's pretty similar to java and .net, and that's true, but at least they have some 3rd party tools that offer source code protection.\n"

    "body": "I agree that this shouldn't be a priority for the electron team, but for many hardware manufacturers, locking to your device comes under business continuity.\n\nI've worked for a couple of hardware manufacturers who's hardware was cheap to produce but had a high retail price because years had been spent adding features to the software. They were plagued by far eastern manufacturers attempting to clone their hardware and/or software. I even disassembled an Android app and found that one company had converted reflected c# code to Java with matching method names and code mistakes! Mostly we were successful at hindering them through obfuscation. \n\nYou could argue that companies in that position should not be using JavaScript, but the speed of cross-platform development using electron can't really be ignored. If a company has IP worth protecting it can probably afford the time to do a pull request.\n\nCould it be added relatively easily to `electron/atom/common/asar/asar_util`? Would the decryption key be trivial to spot in the native executable? It would all be available in memory but would at least stop casual browsing and modification.\n"

The only even remotely feasible way to do it is V8 snapshots, which as mentioned earlier in the thread comes with tons of extremely hacky tradeoffs which the electron team has judged fairly as not worth the hassle.\n\nThe NW.js team implemented it using that appraoch, but they consider it an experimental feature because it is using V8 snapshots in a way that they weren't really designed for. The right approach to solving this problem is to get V8 to support this as a feature, not electron. They're the ones we should be hassling, if anyone.\n\nThat said, @paulcbetts, the edge.js approach you mentioned is intriguing. Are there are any hello world examples or sample apps out there to help those of us interested in this understand how we might use that as a reasonable fallback until such time that V8 provides a good way for electron to implement this a natively supported feature in the future (if ever)?\n"

I don't know of any sample apps that use it but the idea is that you'd write a C# DLL with classes you want to run, then edge.js lets you just call methods on those classes. Something like:\n\n```\nlet jsFunc = edge.func({\n  source: 'MyCSharpNameSpace.SomeClass.AStaticMethod()`,\n  references: [locationOfMyCSharpDll]\n});\n\njsFunc(1,2,3, (result) => { /* this is a callback */ });\n```\n\nThe edge.js website has lots of examples and they work the same way under Electron.

    "body": "> @paulcbetts Want to elaborate why you are deleting my post? You obviously don't care about the future of gaming and using electron as a gateway, very sad.\n\nThese type of posts appear on Electron and NW.js forums constantly. And while this is something both teams would like to give it's users they understand such a feature would inevitability be fruitless. This is due to the design of Chromium, V8, etc. The source has to be exposed in some manner for it to be processed and rendered for the user. Meaning all they can do is make the process difficult to be reversed engineered but not impossible by any means. So source code \"protection\" is more or less a false sense of protection.\n\nSure you have V8 snapshots but there is a reason no one is using them. They are major performance killers and have a lot of gotchas using them. So for any game application you can rule them out.\n\nTo ultimately protect it you need to use a high level compiled language. Sure you can throw the idea of converting JavaScript to C++ or machine code and have a Chromium and Node.js based application is just an insane undertaking which complicates things much more than just saying it. In the end you get something like V8 snapshots which runs so poorly no one uses it anyways. And all the devs and their man hours that could of been used to improve Electron basically got wasted on this feature.\n\nAnother thing you are forgetting is ASAR, Electron, and all it's surrounding technologies are open source. Nothing is preventing you from modifying them to make an encrypted ASAR that can only be decrypted and unpackaged by a custom Electron build. Sure, if someone really wanted to they could find away to crack this and possibly get your source. But this is essentially the same thing you are demanding of the Electron team.\n\n> So having a game written in over 50,000 lines of code and wanting to use electron as a platform, with hundred's of man hours put into the game isn't a good 'tangible fact' or argument for source code protection? Got it. I'm done here, as you don't even want to take into consideration of other people's suggestions or ideas.\n\nAs a developer before you start a project you should understand and know your technologies. If you set out and create a 50,000 line game knowing there is no way to secure the source, then get mad because you can't protect the source, then that is your mistake and not the Electron/NW.js teams mistake.\n"
