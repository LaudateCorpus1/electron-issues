    "body": "I had the same issue with node-webkit. It looks like there are a lot of similarities between the two, so maybe this will be helpful:\n\n`-webkit-app-region: drag;` doesn't follow any layering at all, so `z-index` will have no effect. \n\nTo disable the drag effect for certain elements, use `-webkit-app-region: no-drag;` on the element or its parent. This will disable dragging within the bounding box of the element it is applied to.\n\nFor the hover issue, allow at least 1px of spacing around the hoverable element to allow `mouseout` to be \"seen.\" `-webkit-app-region: drag;` seems to take full control of mouse events where it is applied.\n"
