    "body": "As a co-maintainer of node-webkit and NW.js project, I can share the other side of story here:\n\nBack in late 2012 or early 2013, the founding member @nathansobo of Atom project from Github contacted us to learn how we integrated Node into Chromium, at that time @zcbenz was an intern at Intel who is working on node-webkit  with @rogerwang. Shortly after that @zcbenz was hired by Github, left Intel and node-webkit project.\n\nThe code of what we've written for node-webkit project spans across multiple repositories, mostly in chromium repo, Node.js repo and the node-webkit repo. Only the last one is known by most people. Before @zcbenz  joined the project, the Node integration was done with CEF in the Chromium repo. What @zcbenz did for the project was mostly for the native GUI library according to [a (Chinese) interview of Roger](http://www.csdn.net/article/2014-01-08/2818066-Node-Webkit) . For the sake of easy implementation for the native GUI library, Cheng proposed and moved the code to Content layer, this part of code was a large part of the node-webkit repo.\n\nAt least atom-shell is a derivative work of node-webkit: the code was written following the same idea and steps, though in a tweaked way. Some lines of code are even identical, unique key components are very similar (see the bottom of this post). They changed the Node integration from 1 thread to a 2 threads model and referred to ours as \"buggy\": https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/4862#issuecomment-203760256\n\nThanks,\nKevin.\n\nIdentical lines in question:\nhttps://github.com/nwjs/nw.js/blob/v0.3.7/src/api/bindings_common.cc#L39\nhttps://github.com/electron/electron/blob/17cf6ffbd47e6744537ab6122dfd4bf23edd35bd/atom/renderer/api/atom_api_renderer_ipc.cc#L21\n\nhttps://github.com/nwjs/nw.js/blob/v0.3.7/src/api/dispatcher.cc#L52\nhttps://github.com/electron/electron/blob/17cf6ffbd47e6744537ab6122dfd4bf23edd35bd/atom/renderer/atom_render_view_observer.cc#L52\n\nUnique key component for native GUI API binding:\nhttps://github.com/nwjs/node/blob/nw0.8/src/nw/node_id_weak_map.cc\nhttps://github.com/electron/electron/blob/cd93b9412c2620aa01ab5534a94620d9d01f2738/atom/common/id_weak_map.cc\n"

    "body": "Effectively the biggest difference afaik is that nw.js ends up working directly in Chromium's code far more often, which makes certain things easier, but also is a barrier to entry for contributors because they now have to download and clone all of Chromium and every release of Chromium is now a huge amount of work because they're trying to merge upstream changes more\n\nElectron on the other hand, tries as hard as possible to use Chromium as-is with minimal patches, which means you can build Electron w/o building Chromium which is good, but on the other hand, things that require libchromiumcontent changes are now much harder for Electron to accomplish than nw.js. There are advantages and disadvantages to both approaches.\n"
