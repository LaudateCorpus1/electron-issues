    "body": "The renderer process and GPU process heavily communicates with the main process by IPC, many operations like submitting a form, or navigating to a new location, or drawing certain resources, would trigger a synchronous message to the main process.\n\nSo a blocking operation in main process is easy to block all other processes, and in Chromium's land it is required to put IO and CPU-bound operations in new threads to avoid this. In Electron since you have full power of the main process, you have to taken care of this yourself.\n"
