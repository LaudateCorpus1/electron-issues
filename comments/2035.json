    "body": "Within Electron we are attempting to use a library (adm-zip) which uses `fs`. This library ends up using Electron's version of `fs`  and not `original-fs`.\n\nBut (for various reasons) that's a problem. We want adm-zip to get the `original-fs` version of `fs`. \n\nIs there any way to temporarily reinstate/rebind `fs` to `original-fs` when we call the library?\n\nFurther background: We're using adm-zip to unzip a file which contains a `.asar` file and the Electron `fs` fails on that file.\n"

    "body": "Apologies to revive a closed issue, @zcbenz, I tried your suggestion but get an error:\n`TypeError: Cannot assign to read only property 'F_OK' of #<Object>` when attempting to do `fs[name] = method`, am I missing something obvious?\n\nIf I do a monkey-patch like this - what is a good practice to ensure you aren't breaking something else? Do you need to revert the monkey-patch after including the modules that need `original-fs`? For example, if I do something like:\n\n```\n// monkey patch fs\nvar rimraf = require('rimraf') // needs 'original-fs'\n// should I revert monkey patch now or is it safe to continue?\n```\n\nAny suggestions for best practice around this? This has definitely been problematic for me - I've been forking modules and adding `var fs = process.versions.electron ? require('original-fs') : require('fs')` which is obviously not ideal.\n"
