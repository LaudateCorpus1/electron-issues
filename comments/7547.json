Thanks!\n\nThis is expected behavior when running your app via the `electron` command line.\n\nhttps://github.com/electron/electron/blob/2efb7a12cb24bb447bfa823f34eb3eb372cab630/default_app/main.js#L39-L44\n\nOnce you package your app using something like `electron-packager` then the `default_app.asar` file is not included and this behavior should go away.\n"
