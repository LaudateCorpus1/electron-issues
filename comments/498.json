There's [background on feature here](https://www.webkit.org/blog/1620/webkit-remote-debugging/)\n\nSo, I've been trawling over the code. I can see it flow from:\n- coffeescript [here](https://github.com/atom/atom-shell/blob/8ecc4061a828e93bdaba63e4d31621523ab9c9f9/atom/browser/api/lib/app.coffee#L17-L19)\n- to CPP [here](https://github.com/atom/atom-shell/blob/8ecc4061a828e93bdaba63e4d31621523ab9c9f9/atom/browser/api/lib/app.coffee#L17-L19)\n- then here:  https://github.com/brightray/libchromiumcontent\n- and finally [the chromium content switch source here](http://src.chromium.org/svn/trunk/src/content/public/common/content_switches.cc) \n\nSo, I'm beginning to think this is a bug.
