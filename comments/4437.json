    "body": "I think this is related to the fact that libchromium content makes assumptions about what the ARM environment is. We cannot meet those assumptions for our environment. We need to actually build libchromium/content (and electron) against our actual ARM environment.\n\nThe existing build process (which produces binaries with this problem) downloads its own _separate_ ARM environment using versions of libraries that are not the same as ours in many areas and builds against _those_ libraries instead of building like a normal package against the environment in which it is built.\n\nWe can build V8 and node.js without any issues whatsoever and have no known problems with math, etc. in our environment. All the other code in our environment has no math problems of this sort and is used extensively. The crux of all our issues is the cross compilation process for libchromium on ARM.\n\nSo two things can help:\n1. We need libchromiumcontent / libchromium build help so that we can actually build it on U14.04 machines for x86 ourselves to work on the issue. I realize that the electron folks are just \"users\" of libchromium content and it is not their project, but they are expert users and we're hoping for some help here.\n2. Help or useful advice getting the system to build on ARM _without_ using the extremely fragile \"cross build hack\" that is being used to build against a \"private environment\" for ARM.\n\nIf we can crack these two problems, then we can get working images that are consistent in any custom embedded linux environment.\n"
