Clang 3.4 is available on CentOS 6.5, however Clang 3.5 isn't by default.\n\nHaving tried (and failed) to build it myself, has have many other people, I find it somewhat premature to close this as a non-issue. If there isn't ever a way of building atom-shell for CentOS 6.5, this does seem like an issue to me.\n\nEven stranger, why does atom pull pre-built Ubuntu binaries of atom-shell for Linux flavors?\n"

    "body": "Since you already have clang installed, you may need to set clang as your default compiler by setting `CC` and `CXX` to `clang` and `clang++` (I haven't tested since I don't have CentOS installed). Supporting multiple toolchains would increase lots of maintainance work, so currently only clang is supported as build toolchain on Linux. GCC >= 4.7 should also work though.\n\nWe provide pre-built binaries only for Ubuntu because Ubuntu and its forks are most widely used, providing binaries for other Linux distributions is also [on the plan](https://github.com/atom/atom-shell/issues/259), but it would take lots of work and for now there is no time allocated for it.\n\nIf your sole purpose is to make atom run on CentOS, we could ship `libstdc++.so.6` and `libc.so.6` along with atom-shell, just like how we solved the [`libudev.so` unfound](https://github.com/atom/atom-shell/commit/d9e1861aff327bbda78477eed44ac6392f6c03ad) problem.\n"
