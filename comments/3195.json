This is probably heavier than what you're looking for.\n\nI'd probably choose IndexedDB over reading/writing 100+ rows to a JSON file, especially if that data set was going to get larger.\n\nMisc:\n- Treehouse has a good article about [creating a todo app with IndexedDB](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/create-your-own-to-do-app-with-html5-and-indexeddb).\n- [Quip solved this problem in their app](https://medium.com/@btaylor/react-with-c-building-the-quip-mac-and-windows-apps-c63155c1531b#.tfuzzps3t) by writing data locally to LevelDB, and then syncing LevelDB with their server.\n- The [Dive In To HTML5 article on localstorage](http://diveintohtml5.info/storage.html) is a good resource for learning more about the web storage APIs and localstorage.\n"
