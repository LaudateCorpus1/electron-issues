    "body": "The \"Window manager warning: Buggy client\" warning comes from gnome-session and it happens for lots of popular apps. The real problem is wingpanel crashed, and I think you should report the bug to wingpanel, even though it may be caused by Electron sending wrong messages. Sorry for keep you reporting this to different repos.\n"
