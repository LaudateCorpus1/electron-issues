I would not be surprised if Xamarin allows JS code soon as Microsoft now owns Xamarin and has also been making great strides in with porting node to their own JS engine.\n\nI really hope that some corporate sponsors can get on board to fund such a port / fork of electron for mobile that would eventually be baked into the same framework so we can have a full JS based cross platform application development framework.\n\nThanks Electron team for your great work!\n"

To me, of course it depends case by case, but generally I want my app to be my app no matter what device it is on. I strive for the same features across all devices as much as possible. Why not? I want Chrome to work the same on my desktop as it does on my Android, my iPhone, or my tablet, the same for Firefox, slack, Google Maps. I find it sad when sometimes Google Maps features are platform specific. Back to Chrome, I want to be able to view source and even use the debugger, even on my phone. I sometimes think we don't have the foresight to limit the functionality of our applications appropriately. What if someone does want a feature that works on the desktop version of the app on their phone? The apps should be responsive of course, but core functionality should remain the same as far as possible in my opinion.\n"

The biggest benefit to me would be having one consolidated runtime, where I have access to Node.js and Chromium API's, and said runtime being deployable to all major platforms. Electron and Cordova are in a way doing the same thing for different platforms, minus UI functionality as you may have been talking about. With Cordova you have one codebase that can be deployed to a few major mobile operating systems, said mobile operating systems not being too different in functionality from the major desktop operating systems. An operating system manages processes and their resources, and grants access to hardware that the processes might need. There isn't much of a fundamental difference there between mobile and desktop operating systems. And with browsers beginning to have hardware APIs, the web platform is becoming more and more universal in its ability to deploy in all major environments. So as I see it, Cordova and Electron are accomplishing largely the same tasks but on different operating systems, said operating systems not being fundamentally different, and so why not combine them? 😃\n"

    "body": "@jlord\n\nI build for mobile and desktop and would like to add to the comments from @lastmrs and @noelmace\n\nHere are my thoughts for how it could work for everyone.\n\nThe API that electron exposes has to vary based on if it mobile or desktop. So it is then the responsibility of the developer to do runtime environment detection ( which the electron layer provides) to call a different API depending the the environment context.\nAgain to be clear, it's up to the develop to do the right thing \n\nAs far as UI aspects, again it's down to the developer to do the right thing. I use polymer for all my desktop and mobile projects, and it's down to me to do it correctly.\nI also use golang to write any compiled stuff i need on desktop and mobile to access any hardware.\n\nAt build time, I package for desktop ( amd 64, etc, etc ) and mobile ( android or iOS) where I make a separate package for each OS and chip architecture. I do the same with electron. This allows me to do compile time differences as I need it because some code is hardware dependent.\nI can still include the same code in all the builds and do runtime sniffing, and this is where electron would provide me the environment context.\n\nThe great thing this provides is common tooling at design time and compile time. This is a huge productivity improvement for developers because you can install electron and run a bootstrap bash script to install the iOS and android bits and your writing hello world and packaging and deploying to desktop and mobile.\n\nI did not know that the Google team had updated chrome for iOS to be multii-process. I am super excited to see this.\n\nIf I can help with any of this I would gladly do help.\n"

    "body": "I don't think having two separate APIs is a good idea (@joeblew99). For the end user, I think it'd be better if Electron made it's APIs work on top of Cordova or Node, so that the end user only needs to know one API (Electron API). Then if something isn't covered by the API, end users can dive into Node or Cordova as needed.\n\nAlso, I think it would be important for Electron to define how to use an NPM workflow that works in either case (Cordova or directly on Node). I.e., Electron would have to define it's build system to be compatible with both, using NPM (and ES6 modules would benice too) so that end users wouldn't have to worry about how to build for each. The Node case is already handled, obviously, but there might need to be additional work so that NPM works fine in Cordova.\n\nNote that in Cordova Node.js APIs aren't available, so Electron would need to polyfill some of the native Node.js modules with alternatives that work in Cordova, similar to what Browserify does for the browser. This would help with making a unified API, because if there's something the Electron API doesn't cover, then at least the polyfilled libs means the user can fall-back to Node-based APIs that behind the scenes call Cordova APIs.\n"

This means that without the knowledge of the\nwidgets, and without knowledge of how to modify those widget bindings with\nnative code, then doing something custom becomes very difficult, which is\nnot the case with pure JS/HTML/CSS in a web stack, because with a web stack\nmodifying the internals means modifying the same type of code in the same environment you're already in, not having to worry about a foreign language.\n\n> The second thing to note here is that you actually want to have different UI for mobile and desktop, right. So, in many/most, of the cases, the UI part will not be reused anyway and should be different.\n\nOne of the benefits of using Electron (with it's Web-based front-end), is\nthat we write one code, and it behaves almost _exactly the same_\neverywhere. This would not always be the case with NativeScript, which\ntries to bridge completely different sets of technologies with one language.\n\nI personally like much more the idea of using a web-ui everywhere,\nversus different native UIs everywhere. Some people believe that Native UIs\nare much better than Web UIs. It is true to some extent, and it is the case\nwith developers that don't know the full underlyings of the web. But, with\nproper use of web APIs we can in fact make nice UIs. The web is making huge\nprogress.

    "body": "@trusktr I wholeheartedly agree. I think there is too much stock put into looking native by developers. Native isn't even a consistent ideal. In the last decade, mobile interfaces have changed dozens of times, and aren't even consistent from one android phone to the next. \n\nHaving your app look consistent across all the platforms that a user might access it from is a much better standard to hold. Making them learn two sets of UI symbols and signals just to operate an app on both their iPhone and Windows work machine is terrible.\n"

After years of careful refactoring, all of this code is rejoining Chromium and being moved into the open-source repository.\r\n\r\n> Due to constraints of the iOS platform, all browsers must be built on top of the WebKit rendering engine. For Chromium, this means supporting both WebKit as well as Blink, Chrome's rendering engine for other platforms. That created some extra complexities which we wanted to avoid placing in the Chromium code base. \r\n\r\n> Given Chrome's commitment to open-source code, we've spent a lot of time over the past several years making the changes required to upstream the code for Chrome for iOS into Chromium. Today, that upstreaming is complete, and developers can compile the iOS version of Chromium like they can for other versions of Chromium. Development speed is also faster now that all of the tests for Chrome for iOS are available to the entire Chromium community and automatically run any time that code is checked in."
