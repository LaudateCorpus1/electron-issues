In Atom Linters we get a lot of cases with this error and 100% of them are when the user inputs an incorrect path as executable, We don't want it to chmod and magically try to execute it. It is an error and should be reported as an error.\n\nBesides, the behavior at the moment perfectly matches a terminal, we don't wanna diverge from it\n"

    "body": "@steelbrain I understand those arguments, however all execution permission information is lost when packaging in an `asar`. \n\nMy file _is_ executable before packaging, so the error that I'm getting is not expected to me and reveals an issue with electron (or `asar` specifically) since it's ignoring permissions I'm manually setting as a user, which is even more confusing.\n\nConsider the following example:\n\n``` sh\n$ mkdir asar_test\n$ touch asar_test/foo\n$ chmod 755 asar_test/foo\n$ ls -l asar_test/foo\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 jviotti  staff  0 Nov 26 21:54 asar_test/foo*\n$ asar pack asar_test app.asar\n$ asar extract app.asar output\n$ ls -l output/foo\n-rw-r--r--  1 jviotti  staff  0 Nov 26 21:57 asar_test/foo\n```\n\nI guess the real solution would be making `asar` keep all permissions when extracting out, but have no idea on how to tackle that, and just re-adding the execution permissions on `execFile` sounded like a reasonable default given that the user probably already expects the file to have execution permissions if attempting to `execFile` it.\n"

I'll modify this PR to only set execution permissions if this property is set to `true`, which should prevent the edge case where the user didn't set the execution permissions manually and we diverge from usual behaviour by adding it ourselves.\n"
