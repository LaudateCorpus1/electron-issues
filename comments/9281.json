    "body": "@zcbenz this is about a **minimized** window\r\nOne that was first maximized, then later on minimized, so then it gets restored (unminimized) it should come back in a maximized state.\r\nSo your diagnosis seems unrelated.\r\n\r\nTo reiterate, for a window that is both maximized and then minimized `restore` ignores that it was earlier maximized *in Linux, but not in Windows*\r\n Which means that the definition of `restore` is inconsistent between Windows and Linux."
