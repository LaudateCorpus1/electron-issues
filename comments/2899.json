    "body": ":+1: This is an _amazing_ idea (not just on OS X of course, but on other platforms as well!).\n\nImagine the possibilities: Node-powered dynamic wallpapers that reflect system stats, online feeds etc., and are as easy to layout and style as a web page. Conky with its arcane configuration language would instantly become superfluous. It could also do wonders for screensavers (WebGL!).\n\nI do think this is useful and common enough to warrant inclusion in core Electron. Basically what's needed is a \"desktop\" flag that puts the window in the background, makes it full screen (not covering launchers of course) and disables all user input on it by default.\n\n@Tribex: Do you mean you have done so already with Electron on Linux? Could you share what was necessary to set this up?\n"
