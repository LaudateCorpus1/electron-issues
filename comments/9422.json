Basically it happened because the rpc server only stored 1 reference per remote object per webcontents, but it is possible that the same webcontents has two references to the same object since when a sandbox window is reloaded a new context is created before the old one is freed.\r\n\r\nBecause of the leak before #9314, old window contexts after by reload were never freed, so the bug was hidden."
