    "body": "To clarify why the IPC route isn't working for me:\n\nIn the **preload.js** file applied to the webview I have:\n\n```\nvar ipc = require('ipc');\ndocument.addEventListener('click', function(event) {\n       ipc.send('showKeyboard', event);\n});\n```\n\nThen on the main process **main.js** I have:\n\n```\nipc.on('showKeyboard', function(event, arg){\n    mainWindow.webContents.send('showKeyboard', arg);\n});\n```\n\nThen in the renderer page that contains the webview I have:\n\n```\nipc.on('showKeyboard', function(data){\n    console.log(data);\n});\n```\n\nThe console.log is:\n\n```\nObject {}\n```\n\nSo for some reason the object is blank when I get it back from the click event in the webview. If I send back simple text then I see that fine. Just not events from the click.\n\nI need to know the exact element that was clicked so that I can send commands back down from the virtual keyboard on screen. Any ideas why this isn't working?\n\n**Note: I've also tried this using `sendToHost` like shown here: https://discuss.atom.io/t/how-can-i-access-the-dom-of-a-webview/22349/4?u=iamdriz but the issue still happens so it's not an IPC issue, rather events don't seem to bubble up from the webview object.**\n"
