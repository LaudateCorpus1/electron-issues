When that happens, the zoom for the page is reset. Perhaps the zoom code is detecting the domain based on the requests that page makes while it is loading?\n\nUnfortunately, it seems `setZoomLevelLimits(1.5, 1.5)` doesn't work as a workaround, and causes other problems. For example, you have to specify zoomFactor, and the getZoomFactor method does not return the correct value. Also, it seems like visiting the buggy zoom reset pages with the twitter feed problem now resets the zoomLevel to a different value (that is not 0.0 / 100%).\n"
