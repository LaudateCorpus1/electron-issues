    "body": "@deepak1556 After merging the fix OS X would emit a warning dialog every time when Electron runs:\n\n<img width=\"546\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-09-19 at 4 24 21 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/639601/18624871/af751bc4-7e85-11e6-8ffb-512e2de44284.png\">\n\nAfter a deep looking it seems that the change would just read and store from the same security storage with Chromium browser (and all other Electron apps), which is going to cause problems. And it also makes existing apps lose cookies after updating Electron. \n\nSo I'm reverting the change and reopening this issue.\n"

Specifically, the `keychain-access-group` entitlement seems to be governing. Unfortunately, this is at about the edge of my xcode experience. I did find these, which might help:\r\n\r\n1.
