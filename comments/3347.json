    "body": "Nice! Just a few thoughts, could add `WebViewManager::TransferGuest(sourceGuestInstanceId, targetElementInstanceId, targetGuestInstanceId)` and let `guest-view-manger` use it to change mapping of guestinstanceid to embedder. Also `ipc` operations in `web-view` can be moved to `guest-view-internal`and ones' in `web-view-ref` can be handled by `guest-view-manager`. Not sure about the need for `WebViewRef` class.\n"
