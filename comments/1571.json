    "body": "So, this is a good start, but I think the actual issues here aren't caught by this PR (though with @zcbenz's blessing I still think this is a good test to have just for sanity's sake). Here are the three main things:\n- Integrated / NTLM authentication is disabled, even though the browser doesn't need any user interaction to send it across. I think I've fixed that here: https://github.com/atom/brightray/pull/104\n- In `network_delegate.cc` (https://github.com/atom/brightray/blob/master/browser/network_delegate.cc#L85), when OnAuthRequired fires, we always return `AUTH_REQUIRED_RESPONSE_NO_ACTION` - this effectively means that at times where Google Chrome would pop a native dialog to ask for the password, we just say \"Didn't work\" and fail it. \n\nInstead, we probably need to mark all of these requests as `AUTH_REQUIRED_RESPONSE_IO_PENDING`, then call out to a callback provided by the user (i.e. something like `app.setNetworkCredentialCallback`, that lets you provide a callback which gives creds). We probably _also_ need a default implementation that drops down a user/pass prompt.\n- When we are prompted for credentials from a proxy server that uses Basic Auth, we fail similarly. I haven't debugged down to see if this is the same code path or a separate one, but if it was the same one, that'd be super cool. \n"
