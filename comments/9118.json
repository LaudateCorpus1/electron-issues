    "body": "I think this can be resolved by making all of the key's assigned in `const defaultPrintingSetting = {}` available options within `WebContents.prototype.printToPDF = function (options, callback) {...}`. Then in my project file I can check for the screen's scaleFactor and/or it can be as simple as changing `fitToPageEnabled: false` to `fitToPageEnabled: true`. Won't know for sure until I run tests though. \r\n\r\nPlease reference: [https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/lib/browser/api/web-contents.js](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/lib/browser/api/web-contents.js)\r\n\r\nNote: I need to wrap up the project that's having this issue and would prefer just modifying the file from my local install, but I haven't been able to find the Electron `.js` source files. If anyone can point me in the right direction, I would greatly appreciated it!"
