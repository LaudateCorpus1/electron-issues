    "body": "I've run into this multiple times. The way I work around it is to create an element containing the cursor image positioned where the cursor would be after the key is pressed and then on the mouse move event when the cursor reappears I hide the element.\n\nThe downsides to this approach are that the cursor gets cut off on the edge of the window and if you are trying to do anything where you need to hold a key down while moving the cursor... well, hardware cursors feel much more responsive than html elements so it's kind of a _drag_.\n"
