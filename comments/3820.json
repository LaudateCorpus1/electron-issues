    "body": "I believe this is exactly what I am experiencing with #3803. I also have nodejs features disabled. Mine also hangs on version `0.35.4.` and `0.36.0`.\n\nAlso let me add that I can only get it to freeze in TravisCI when running on their new `docker` infrastructure. You can trigger the old architecture by passing `sudo: required` in your `.travis.yml` file. When doing that tests will pass 100% of the time.\n"
