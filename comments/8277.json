    "body": "Cannot find any test app associated with #7000\r\n\r\nAre up using `display: inline-flex`?\r\n\r\n>Please note that the webview tagâ€™s style uses display:flex; internally to ensure the child object element fills the full height and width of its webview container when used with traditional and flexbox layouts (since v0.36.11). Please do not overwrite the default display:flex; CSS property, unless specifying display:inline-flex; for inline layout.\r\n\r\nFrom: http://electron.atom.io/docs/api/web-view-tag/\r\n\r\nThis is what I typically use in on webviews that I want to fill the entire window:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n#webview {\r\n  position: absolute;\r\n  top: 0;\r\n  left: 0;\r\n  width: 100%;\r\n  height: 100%;\r\n  display: inline-flex !important;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNOTE: in the app that I am writing the scenario I use is to hide the webview and show it. I don't have any extra resize event handler to make sure the webview is resized correctly. I just use CSS like above."
