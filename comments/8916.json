    "body": "@amoshg Just in case it helps: I was running into a similar issue on ubuntu 16.04 using Xvfb. Electron would sometimes just hang and stay open indefinitely, and sometimes would just crash immediately before it ran any of my app code.\r\n\r\nI figured out that both cases happened because Xvfb crashed, because of a memory leak unless you include the `-noreset` option: [Xvfb Memory Leak Workaround](http://blog.jeffterrace.com/2012/07/xvfb-memory-leak-workaround.html)\r\n\r\nI figured this out by enabling logging (`export ELECTRON_ENABLE_LOGGING=true`). You might want to try that out if you haven't already"
