    "body": "The error occurs when we are violating a security origin policy during navigation and it happens because initial navigation will end up with `data:text/html,chromewebdata` and when devtools is opened it sees origin violation. There is nothing we can do in this case, the behavior is same with chrome.\r\n* Open new-tab\r\n* navigate to non-existent local url\r\n* open devtools\r\n\r\nYou can listen to `did-fail-load` event of webContents for better error messages."
