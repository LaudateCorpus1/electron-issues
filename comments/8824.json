A little digging shows the request body is based on mediaKeys.createSession not sure why it fails for you, but it is definitely linked to the original issue of plugin not loaded on first run with error `DOMException: Unable to create the CDM for the key system com.widevine.alpha.`\r\n\r\n> The Star Trek intro plays for about 8 seconds before the Shaka player forces it to pause.\r\n\r\nHmm, the video played for me completely.
