    "body": "I just confirmed that electron tagged `v1.4.15` as `latest`:\r\n```\r\n$ npm view electron | grep latest\r\n  'dist-tags': { latest: '1.4.15', beta: '1.6.1' },\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think this is because `>v1.5.0` are still under beta as you said. In my opinion, it's better to have a `-beta` postfix in the beta versions to make it clear it's under beta."
