Possibly dangling pointers.\n\nInitial gut feeling tells me this is not a problem with Electron since we've had none of these reports/issues in Atom (which up until recently was running on Electron 0.22.3). Although 0.25.0 did upgrade Chromium to v42, so not impossible the problem lies in there somewhere.\n\nYou mentioned a native library/add-on. Is it possible it's doing something that could be causing issues with changed APIs in El Capitan?\n\nMost likely @zcbenz can shed more/better light on this than me. I'm not really familiar with the guts of Electron or Chromium.\n"

Locations could be totally random and the issue could be somewhere in our native add-on. I don't think the cause is related to some APIs changed in El Capitan, but El Capitan could be more susceptible to such bug.\n\nAny suggestion / hint how to debug it?\n"

If it's possible to run your native code in some form of standalone mode, you might have some success using something like Valgrind's memcheck tool (or equivalent). Not sure how well it's going to behave in the context of a full-blown Electron app, but that might work as well (but will be really, really slow).\n\nUltimately I think you might have to run at least some of the diagnostics on an El Capitan machine in case the bug is only present on such systems.\n"
