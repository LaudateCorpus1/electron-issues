    "body": "@charlex I can't find the docs now but basically an NSButton will always have the width of the original image regardless of scaling applied to it.  Your initial image is quite large so the button that is made inherits that width.\r\n\r\nThe touchbar then scales down the image but due to the way the button was sized it is exceedingly big.  If you resize your images to be the correct size for a touch bar then the button will be the correct size as well üëç "
