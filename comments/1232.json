    "body": "Good news!!!\n\nSince nan seemed to be the unhappy module after my last round of build attempts, I decided to see if any nan updates were available.  Turns out v1.7 was recently released.  I changed the package.json inside of the ursa module to download the dependency from github.  I was then able to successfully rebuild ursa using:\n\nnode-gyp rebuild --target=0.21.3 -arch=x64 --target_platform=linux --dist-url=https://gh-contractor-zcbenz.s3.amazonaws.com/atom-shell/distcd\n\nAnd after the successful rebuild, my project launches now as well!\n\nThanks for the help everyone!  Very happy that I can move forward now.\n"

    "body": "@mattcollier: Nice. Sorry for the typo with x64 in --arch although it doesn't (really) matter (in that case).\nI can confirm that it works with `nan@1.7.0`. Maybe close this issue and open up a new one over at ursa and tell them that?\n**Edit:** Once you're in the `ursa` dir you can also just do `npm i -S nan@1.7.0`.\n\n@paulcbetts I have expressed myself wrong. \"has nothing to do ...\" is wrong, since there is a relation between atom-shell/node version and module version. I was influenced (in my choice of words) by your \"zero to do with a real version number\" (which is correct). tl;dr of course you're correct, but [I meant the same](https://github.com/bwin/aspm/blob/master/src/index.coffee#L112).\n(It's amazing how long it took me to write these two or three sentences and after consulting Google Translate twice I'm still not satisfied. So I most likely meant to say something completely different.**Edit:**™ :wink: )\n"
