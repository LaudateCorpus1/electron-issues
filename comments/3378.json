It can be fixed by rebuilding this 2 modules or installing or downloading correct version. \n\nAnd next we have bug with objects inspecting: \n\n```\nRuntime.getProperties failed.\nObject #0# not found\n```\n\nOn this step I decide to find some other debugger )\n"

    "body": "In order to use `node-inspector` you need to:\n1. Install a patched version of `node-pre-gyp` so that `node-inspector` and its dependencies can actually find the native modules built in the following step.\n2. Rebuild `node-inspector` and its dependencies (specifically the native modules) to target the same Node runtime as Electron.\n3. Execute `node-inspector` using Electron instead of regular Node, this can be done by setting a flag that starts Electron in \"Run As Node\" mode where Electron only loads the Node runtime without any of the Chromium stuff. This is important because the `fs` module in Electron is able to read files in an ASAR archive whereas plain old Node cannot, and node-inspector is going to want to read some things from the app ASAR.\n\nThis worked for me in v0.34, so hopefully it still works in more recent versions. I've got a couple of [Grunt tasks](https://github.com/debugworkbench/hydragon/tree/bf49f60ae1e9d6ded478ff3d1e591b7f568bb20f/build/tasks) to handle steps 1 & 3, and a patched version of [node-pre-gyp](https://github.com/enlight/node-pre-gyp/tree/detect-electron-runtime-in-find) that probably needs to be updated with changes from upstream for v0.36 (because Node got upgraded from v4 to v5).\n"

Here are my instructions so far\n1. `npm i node-inspector`\n2. `npm i git+https://git@github.com/enlight/node-pre-gyp.git#detect-electron-runtime-in-find`\n3. Find the Electron Node.js runtime version (https://github.com/atom/electron/blob/master/docs/tutorial/using-native-node-modules.md#native-node-module-compatibility)\n4. So, for Node 5.1.1...\n   `node_modules/.bin/node-pre-gyp reinstall --target=5.1.1 --directory node_modules/v8-debug`\n5. run node-inspector\n   `ATOM_SHELL_INTERNAL_RUN_AS_NODE=1 build/develop/electron.exe node_modules/node-inspector/bin/inspector.js`\n6. run electron with `--debug-brk`\n7. go to the debugging URL\n\nHowever, I think the node-pre-gyp reinstall step is not working as I get\n\n```\nError: Cannot find module 'path\\to\\project\\node_modules\\v8-debug\\build\\debug\\v0.7.0\\electron-v0.36-win32-x64\\debug.node'\n```\n\nWhen I run the node-pre-gyp I get\n\n```\nnode-pre-gyp info it worked if it ends with ok\nnode-pre-gyp info using node-pre-gyp@0.6.17\nnode-pre-gyp info using node@4.2.3 | win32 | x64\nnode-pre-gyp info chdir node_modules/v8-debug/\n[v8-debug] Removing \"path\\to\\project\\node_modules\\v8-debug\\build\\debug\\v0.7.0\\node-v47-win32-x64\"\nnode-pre-gyp info check checked for \"path\\to\\project\\node_modules\\v8-debug\\build\\debug\\v0.7.0\\node-v47-win32-x64\\debug.node\" (not found)\nnode-pre-gyp http GET https://node-inspector.s3.amazonaws.com/debug/v0.7.0/node-v47-win32-x64.tar.gz\nnode-pre-gyp http 200 https://node-inspector.s3.amazonaws.com/debug/v0.7.0/node-v47-win32-x64.tar.gz\nnode-pre-gyp info install unpacking debug.node\nnode-pre-gyp info tarball done parsing tarball\nnode-pre-gyp info validate Running test command: 'C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\node.exe --eval 'require(\\'path\\to\\project/node_modules/v8-debug/build/debug/v0.7.0/node-v47-win32-x64/debug.node\\')''\n[v8-debug] Success: \"path\\to\\project\\node_modules\\v8-debug\\build\\debug\\v0.7.0\\node-v47-win32-x64\\debug.node\" is installed via remote\nnode-pre-gyp info ok\n```\n\nso I guess that instead I need to run\n\n```\n node_modules/.bin/node-pre-gyp reinstall --target=0.36.2 --runtime=electron --directory node_modules/v8-debug/\n```\n\nwhich of course isn't available as a binary.

Am I on the right track?\n"

As suggested in the linked tutorial I just use [electron-rebuild](https://github.com/paulcbetts/electron-rebuild) to perform steps 2-3. Keep in mind that `node-inspector` has more than one native dependency (`v8-debug`, and `v8-profiler` are the two I recall) so it's probably best to rebuild everything in `node_modules`.\n"
