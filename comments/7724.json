    "body": "> It looks that Accelerator is not object but abstract concept in form of string??\n\nIn JS terms, an `Accelerator` is just a string.  It is parsed into an Accelerator on the native side of things.\n\n> not sure if it is a bug or I just not used this properly.\n\nAppears to be a bug of some kind, I just tried your code on my mac though and can't reproduce the error.  Can you provide a minimal app that demonstrates the issue\n"

    "body": "well, I haven't put it in `app.on('ready', () => {.....})`\nthis were errors from. \n\nBut I  still think docs should be better. In Accelerator article could be something (even link like \"see also\") for actual use of it and it could be written that it's string not an object (I think not every user of Electron has to be advanced Googler - most programmers aren't).\n"
