I can just alt-tab back and forth between Spotify and Slack a dozen times, and 1 or 2 of those times, Slack is drawn without a title bar or window borders, as seen here.\n\nInterestingly enough, if I click where the title bar should be, I can move the window. And if I hover over where borders and corners should be, I get the resize cursor, and I can drag to resize the window. After that operation, the window is redrawn completely, 100% of the time. \n"
