    "body": "How I resolved fixing the missing icons from windows buttons XFCE4 panel... mostly. \r\n\r\nBy using `seticon`, `xwininfo` in a bash script which really does nothing much but use `xwininfo` to find the window title, and use a predefined icon path to pass to the window ID returned by `xwininfo`.  NOTE: the seticon `get-seticon.sh` portion of the script isn't tested, as installing `seticon` was difficult to install, until finding this gist from github user **unhammer** thanks a bunch! `xwininfo` should be already available, if not it's easy to install.\r\n\r\n...and by mostly sometimes the `.desktop` file overrides the `/bin/bash ~/bin/fix-termius-icon.sh` and back to broken icon usually on reboots it seems, but if annoys enough just running the bash script after it's annoyed me enough.  Electron hopefully saves everyone's sanity, soon. \r\n\r\nSpecs:\r\nUbuntu 16.04, XFCE4 Win Buttons panel, Slack and Termius SSH ugly default icons.\r\n\r\n```\r\n# configure\r\nWIN_NAME=\"Termius\";\r\nAPP_EXEC=\"/snap/bin/termius-app\";\r\nAPP_ICON=\"/snap/termius-app/current/meta/gui/icon.png\";\r\n\r\n# how long to wait before looking for window title\r\nTIME_WAIT_FOR_WINDOW=3;\r\n\r\n$APP_EXEC &\r\nsleep $TIME_WAIT_FOR_WINDOW;\r\nenv BAMF_DESKTOP_FILE_HINT=\"/var/lib/snapd/desktop/applications/termius-app_termius-app.desktop\";\r\nID=$(xwininfo -name \"$WIN_NAME\"|grep xwininfo|cut -d ' ' -f 4);\r\nxseticon -id $ID $APP_ICON;\r\n\r\n```\r\nIf it doesn't work, bash it!
