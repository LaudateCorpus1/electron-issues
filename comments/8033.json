But I felt I had to point out regarding one of your questions.\r\n\r\n> Being Electron based on Chrome, how is it possible that it can't auto-update on Linux, given the fact that Chrome can?\r\n\r\nAlthough you are correct and Electron is based on Chromium, the auto-update mechanisms provided by Electron aren't the update mechanisms from Chromium.  They are in fact different for different OS's.\r\n\r\nOn windows we use https://github.com/Squirrel/Squirrel.Windows and on macOS we use https://github.com/Squirrel/Squirrel.Mac"

    "body": "> Tons of applications (Google Chrome, Spotify, Steam...) use auto-updaters in a combination with storing the application's files in the user's folder (so there is no need for sudo password when updating).\r\n\r\nGoogle Chrome and Spotify both use debian repositories for updating on debian based systems, not auto-updaters. On installation they add a debian repository so that `apt-get` will pull in updates.\r\n\r\nSteam is a hybrid where the bootloader is updated via a debian repository, but that bootloader then installs/auto-updates core steam in the home directory.\r\n\r\nI personally prefer using the native package management system rather than auto-updates so that I can update anything in one place, but can see the appeal.\r\n\r\nGiven the variety in linux systems, a universal auto-update system may be tricky to implement."
