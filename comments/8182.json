System wide, if you want to listen for keypresses inside your app to do things like\r\n\r\n> draw a straight line\r\n\r\nuse the `keyup` and `keydown` window events.  E.g.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nwindow.addEventListener('keydown', (event) => {\r\n  if (event.which === 16) {\r\n    // Shift key is down\r\n  }\r\n});\r\n```"
