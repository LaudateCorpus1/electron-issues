    "body": "@felicienfrancois That‚Äôs not quite right‚Äîthe resource load actually succeeds, and it doesn‚Äôt matter whether it succeeds or fails anyhow. The issue is that `executeJavaScript` is called _during_ the resource load. When that happens, the script will simply never get executed, which is the issue. To be clear, the resource load shouldn‚Äôt have _anything to do with the success or failure of `executeJavaScript`_ after the main frame is loaded.\n\nThe reason why is actually extremely clear if you look into https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/lib/browser/api/web-contents.js#L119 and the implementation of Chromium‚Äôs `WebContents::IsLoading`. The example here is just illustrative.\n"
