    "body": "> Perhaps we should use graceful-fs or ignore delete errors?\r\n\r\nThe file is deleted is to ensure the crash dump is created(and not uploaded), my guess is that the crash reporter was still writing to the file when `unlink` was called. The reason I explicitly `unlink` the dump is because of some differences in how crashReporter directories are handled(it seems on mac they are initialized at startup and not changed later?), causing dumps from other tests to leak into this test.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I think it is better to not depend on `unlink` to know that the dump was created. I will send a PR to fix this soon."
