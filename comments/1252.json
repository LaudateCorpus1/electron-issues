    "body": "How about a var `allowQuit= false` and in your `will-quit`-handler only call `preventDefault()` if `!allowQuit`. And when you finally want to quit, set `allowQuit = true`.\nIn my head this makes sense, but I'll have to try it out. (I can only test on linux/windows BTW.)\n\n**Edit:** You probably already thought of this, so feel free to call bullsh*t on this...\n"
