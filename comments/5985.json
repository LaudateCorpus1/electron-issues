    "body": "My guess is that spell check will only check against one language at a time. So if it's expecting German words, English words will be marked misspelled. Looking at the documentation for the OS X spellchecker that `node-spellchecker` uses:\n\n> Returns the current language used in spell checking.\n\nSo I believe you can only be checking spelling in one language. \n\n_EDIT If you're using `node-spellchecker` as your provider, it does [only accept one language](https://github.com/atom/node-spellchecker/blob/master/lib/spellchecker.js#L14) at this time._ \n\n_I'm going to close this out here since updates would need to happen in [`node-spellchecker`](https://github.com/atom/node-spellchecker). If you know of another provider that supports multiple languages, please create an issue here to support that in Electron's API._\n"

    "body": "The problem is - we try to check only One language - German. But it starts to check English text too.\n\nWith 'ru-RU'  everything works fine - webFrame.setSpellCheckProvider underlines wrong russian words and doesn't underlined English words at all:\n\n```\nwebFrame.setSpellCheckProvider('ru-RU', true, {spellCheck: function (text) {\n    //this code is performed only when user input text in Russian, when Eng - no  \n    return !customSpellChecker.isMisspelled(text);\n}});\n```\n\nSo I guess the issue is not in custom spell-check provider, but in webFrame.setSpellCheckProvider.\n"

The spell checker under `ru-RU` probably just discards all non-russian words, while when language is German it is hard to distinguish English words. \n"
