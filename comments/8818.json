When I open my sligtly configured firefox, there is not a single bit that is transmitted until I open an url and then only the requsted webserver will see any connection. Therefore I would never use chromium, but this issue is about its use in electron and if I need to worry about its use of chromium.\r\n\r\n@tarruda: the question is if the chromium components used in electron contain functionality that transmits data to google or has any other questionable functions regarding privacy"
