    "body": "Electron is not designed to be embedded by other applications, and providing such interface is no easy work. If you want to embed a browser the best choice is to use [CEF](https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/cef).\n\nIf you have interests in making Electron embeddable you can start with [how Chromium works](http://dev.chromium.org/Home), since the Electron is basically a custom build of Chrome browser.\n"
