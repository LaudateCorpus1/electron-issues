    "body": "Hey all, can anyone see why my output doesn't get logged? Webdriverio starts up my app with client.init() for sure, but doesn't do anything else it seems. I start chromedriver like the docs say and I execute the following file\n`node test/test.js`\n\n``` js\nconst Path = require('path');\nvar webdriverio = require('webdriverio');\nvar childProcess = require('child_process');\nvar binPath = chromedriver.path;\n\n// Start webdriverio\nvar client = webdriverio.remote({\n    host: \"localhost\", // Use localhost as chrome driver server\n    port: 9515,        // \"9515\" is the port opened by chrome driver.\n    desiredCapabilities: {\n        browserName: 'chrome',\n        chromeOptions: {\n            binary: Path.join(__dirname, '../node_modules/.bin/electron'), \n            args: ['app=' + Path.join(__dirname, '..')],\n        }\n    }\n});\n\nclient\n    .init().then(function() {\n        console.log('reached');\n    });\n```\n\nEdit: It seems `client.init()` stalls such that `then()` never gets reached? What could cause this?\n\nEdit2: Woah, it seems these were the offending lines in my `index.js` that were causing client.init() to stall:\n\n``` js\n// visit localhost:9222 to see devtools remotely\nApp.commandLine.appendSwitch('remote-debugging-port', '9222');\n```\n\nThis appends arguments to chromium and `chromeOptions.args` appends arguments to electron so they shouldn't conflict, right?\n"
