    "body": "Hi @zcbenz and @sindresorhus \n\nThis is my first pull contribution to Electron, so pardon for any faults.\n\nThe Motive Of This Change is to Update the **Electron Documentation** Page [\"Technical Differences Between Electron and NW.js\"](http://electron.atom.io/docs/development/atom-shell-vs-node-webkit/) in Point **4. Multi-context** which tells the user that a difference between Electron & Nw.js is that NW.js uses only Node context and web context that is part of Single Context mode which till date is the default in NW.js.\n\nBut that thing I want to update the users with is that Since Nw.js 0.13 there is a **Mixed Content** Mode which is similar to **Multi-Context** mode in Electron, but  it has to be achieved with some workarounds and is not the default mode in Nw.js while in Electron the Multi-Context mode is set by default so there users have an advantage in Using Electron. That is the difference I want to mention. \n\nNow You being the expert, can write it more appropriately and in a grammatically correct and concise/short manner. \n"
