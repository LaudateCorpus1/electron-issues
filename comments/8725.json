    "body": "I have found a workaround for this bug:\r\n\r\nThere seems to be an issue with touch events. Sometimes they seem to get disabled for no apparent reason (maybe there is a bug in the driver or a bug in electron for some drivers). You can observe this behavior by listening to the events (touchend and mousedown). Normally, the touchend event is fired followed by a mousedown event. When this bug occurs, only the touchend event is fired (I have also listened to all other mouse and touchscreen related events -- the touch is not cancelled and no mouse event is fired).\r\n\r\nA workaround is to always enabled touch events (the default behavior is automatic). Add this line to your main.js file [(Source)](https://discuss.atom.io/t/touch-events-and-scrolling/36575/3):\r\n\r\n    app.commandLine.appendSwitch('touch-events', 'enabled');\r\n\r\nPossible values are: automatic (default), enabled (forces touch events), disabled (no touch events -- the same behavior as described by this bug report)."
