    "body": "@danhp thanks for looking into it! So the reason I mentioned it in the first place is because I think it'd be a good idea to be able to show a popup panel on mouse down instead of mouse up. By using mouse down, by the time the user lifts their finger from the button, the panel would already be visible, making the app feel much faster.\n\nIf you hold the mouse button down over a native OSX menu bar app, the panels show up on mouse down (not mouse up) so I was trying to replicate that behaviour as close as I could.\n"

    "body": "@keithpitt Yup, that's the reason I looked into this (wanted the tray to behave like native). But exposing a `mouse-down` event won't bring it closer to being solved as it will allow you to show a menu but not highlight the tray icon itself. So it's better to just let the app handle all of that for you. As for having it show on `mouseDown`, long presses leave the tray icon highlighted until the next click but with no menu showing.\n\nFor reference the Google Drive tray runs into a very similar problem but overcomes it by having a custom menu that they have full control over.\n"
