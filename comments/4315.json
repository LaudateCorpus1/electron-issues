With a little creativity I found the same can be done in Electron using the remote debugging port.\n\nEnable it in your main.js:\n\n``` javascript\napp.commandLine.appendSwitch('remote-debugging-port', '9222');\n```\n\nRetrieve the instance from the /json reponse. For me it is usually always the first instance. If not change the integer in `json[0].id;` until it gets your frame or webview.\n\n``` javascript\nvar devtools = '127.0.0.1:9222'\nvar devurl = 'http://' + devtools + '/devtools/inspector.html?ws=' + devtools + '/devtools/page/';\n$.getJSON('http://' + devtools + '/json', function(json) {\n  devurl = devurl + json[0].id;\n  console.log(devurl);\n});\n```\n\n`devurl` is the URL for the devtools jailed to your iframe. Either open it in a new window or create another iframe/webview and open it in there.\n"

And the method I posted will give you the desired effect. So if it is possible to switch your iframe to a webview then you have a possible solution. If not then you will have to wait for a PR to be submitted that allows this.\n\nIncidentally I came up with this work around when I was still using NW.js and switched my iframe to a webview to fix issues with using an iframe. But the webview was incompatible with their jail dev tools feature. I made the switch to Electron once I discovered this because the only missing feature holding me back was jailing the dev tools.
