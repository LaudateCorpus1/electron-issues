    "body": "The docs of `session` module is a bit complex case:\n- the module name is `session`, and there are a few methods of it;\n- there is a class named `Session`;\n- the instance of `Session` class is named as `ses`.\n\nThe layout is of the docs is:\n\n``` markdown\n# session\n\n## Methods\n\n### session.xxx\n\n## Properties\n\n### session.xxx\n\n## Class: Session\n\n### Instance Events\n\n#### Event: xxx\n\n### Instance Methods\n\n#### ses.xxxx\n```\n\nThe logic is:\n- `Methods`, `Properties` and `Class: Session` belong to the `session` module, so they have `##` level;\n- the `session` module's methods and properties use `session.xxx` as title;\n- `Instance Events` and `Instance Methods` belong to the `Class: Session` instead of `session` module, so they have `###` level;\n- the `Session` class's methods use `ses.xxx` as title, since `ses` is the name of `Session` class's instance;\n- the instance of `Session` is named `ses` because `session` is already used as module's name, if we mix the name then it would be hard to distinguish between module methods and `Session`'s instance methods.\n\nPros:\n- Names from docs can be copied to code without modification;\n- It is possible to put multiple classes inside one page (think of Node's `http` module);\n- It is possible to mix classes and module's methods inside one page.\n\nCons:\n- The level of titles can be too deep;\n- The class instance's name can be very ugly.\n\nThe whole idea follows Node's documentation style, though I don't any page documents the rules.\n"
