    "body": "@cossacksman You can disable/enable user based window controls for events like `maximize` with [`setMinimizable`](http://electron.atom.io/docs/v0.37.6/api/browser-window/#winsetminimizableminimizable-os-x-windows), [`setMaximizable`](http://electron.atom.io/docs/v0.37.6/api/browser-window/#winsetmaximizablemaximizable-os-x-windows), [`setClosable`](http://electron.atom.io/docs/v0.37.6/api/browser-window/#winsetclosableclosable-os-x-windows) and [`setFullScreenable`](http://electron.atom.io/docs/v0.37.6/api/browser-window/#winsetfullscreenablefullscreenable).\n\nHowever you can't prevent `maximize` events that are fired programmatically. You should prevent this by improving your code or by creating a central piece of code who decides if you can `maximize` the current window. \n\nI don't know if by setting `setMaximizable` to `false` prevents the window from maximizing when you click the titlebar on Windows, because i'm on OSX, but you could try and I would like to know the result :)\n\nI understand what you are trying to do with the `beforemaximize` events and i could see use cases where that would be helpfull (for example: 'are you sure you want to close this unsaved file?')\n\nI would like to know what others are thinking about those events.\n"

    "body": "Sadly I can't just disable pointer events on the window decoration else users might get confused where else to drag their windows from; and I'm assuming that would affect children as well such as the window control buttons inside that element but thanks for the suggestion.\n\nThis topic does sound rather pedantic but for windows that most certainly should not be maximizable it is pretty tedious.. The reason I haven't just set whether the window can be maximizable for each window with a custom property is because I handle all windows with one channel from IPC:\n\n```\nipc.on('maximize', () => {\n    let focusedWindow = BrowserWindow.getFocusedWindow();\n\n    if (focusedWindow.isMaximized()) {\n        focusedWindow.unmaximize();\n    } else {\n        focusedWindow.maximize();\n    }\n});\n```\n\nAnother solution might be to have the window store an empty object, which you can populate with custom properties? That would be easy to make checks when manipulating a window like this, and plenty of other things.\n"
