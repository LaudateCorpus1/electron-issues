    "body": "The only way I've found to fix this, is via distributing a shim EXE that wraps the original EXE but is marked as a console application. This is why Visual Studio ships with `devenv.com` as well as `devenv.exe` - because PowerShell and CMD both prefer `.com` over `.exe` when given a simple executable name (i.e. `atom`), you can use this as a hack to make a GUI application act like a console program when invoked by a console.\n\nTo do this for your own app, steal https://github.com/Squirrel/Squirrel.Windows/blob/master/src/Update/Update.com and rename it to `atom.com` (or whatever your EXE name is), and put it in the same directory as your `atom.exe`. Now when you invoke `atom`, it will prefer `atom.com` which will turn around and immediately invoke your `atom.exe` but pipe the output properly\n"

If you want to make the program fully silent, you want `... > /dev/null 2>&1` which first redirects _stdout_ to /dev/null and then connects stderr to stdout (to be exact, the current end point of stdout which is /dev/null).
