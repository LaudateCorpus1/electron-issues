Or do we let users just do app.commandLine.appendSwitch ?\n\nThe locations of plugins are different on different platforms, so hard-coding them in `package.json` might not work well. Using `app.commandLine.appendSwitch` is fine, and we should mention the switches in `chrome-command-line-switches.md`.\n\n> Currently flash plugin support is implemented though just as a flag for now, start electron with --ppapi-flash-path. Will change the behaviour to ppapi-plugins-dir option just like extra-plugins-dir.\n\nI think it is fine to just support Flash plugin for now. \n"
