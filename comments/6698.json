Both `runas` and `win-mouse` loaded fine. \n\nThe UNC path does not seem to be an issue...I tested with older version of electron on windows 7 (where edge-atom-shell works), manually modified the name of the .node file in the app.asar.unpacked directory, and have seen the same error: `Specified module could not be loaded \\\\?\\C:\\\\...`. So this would seem to indicate the path works fine when I had not modified the file name.\n\nAny other troubleshooting suggestions?\n"
