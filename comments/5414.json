When it's completing the installation process, it goes to delete the \"old\" files, and it always deletes the folder with the lower semver version number. Took us a while to figure out!\n"

Anyways, this probably shouldn't happen in a normal production setting since higher versions of .nupkg will always be uploaded to the release URL.\n"
