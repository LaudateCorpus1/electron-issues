Sounds are playing as normal, But nothing seems to update visually, as if like the visual rendering is frozen. Electron also won't accept input. Mouse clicks don't work. If the dev tools are open I also lose the ability to interact with that. It happens very consistently with certain apps. Even to the point that it will freeze at exactly the same time every time. \n"

    "body": "Ok. Finally have a better answer to this question. I updated the [example project](https://github.com/golgobot/electron-bug) to show how an electron shell that is spawned by an electron shell eventually freezes its rendering. The culprit seems to be `console.log`. If you call that over 200 times in a shell spawned from a shell, it freezes the rendering of that shell until that shell's parent is killed. Please read the `README.md` for more information on how to run the example. \n"
