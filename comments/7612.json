IMO that isn't too big of an issue.  Also I don't know if we could / should / will move to promises as it is one hell of a breaking change it was more of a \"if we do it definitely shouldn't happen till then\".\n\n> Consistency is nice, but nothing docs cannot solve, and future-proofing is more important.\n\nThis is just IMO but I would normally take consistency over **partially** adopting new technologies.  Using a library that has a mixture of promises and callbacks requires constant doc lookups and adds extra hassle / time to what should be a simply experience.  Again, IMO, but I'd much rather know that either Electron is promise driven or callback driven.  Given that lots of Chromium's internals still use callbacks and wrapping those in promises would be time consuming and \"temporary\" code, I think we would be jumping on the Promise train is a bit too soon.\n\nBut this is a discussion for lots of people to have another time in another place if we want to discuss adopting promise logic.\n\n_Argh I typed too much_\n</details>\n"

I was also able to simplify the code a little bit since LSGetApplicationForURL is also thread safe.\n\nI'm able to determine the underlying error message in some cases from the `OSStatus` returned from LSGetApplicationForURL.\n\nSo for example, running these examples would return the following error messages:\n\n``` js\n  electron.shell.openExternal('ooops', {}, function(err) {\n    console.log('Should error with bad URL:', err)\n  })\n\n  electron.shell.openExternal('noappforscheme://oops', {}, function(err) {\n    console.log('Should error with no application for URL:', err)\n  })\n\n  electron.shell.openExternal('file:///notfound', {}, function(err) {\n    console.log('Should error with fail to open:', err)\n  })\n```\n\n```\nShould error with bad URL: Error: Invalid URL\n    at Error (native)\n    at App.<anonymous> (/Users/gabe/Projects/Electron/electron-quick-start/main.js:42:18)\n    at emitTwo (events.js:111:20)\n    at App.emit (events.js:191:7)\n\nShould error with no application for URL: Error: No application in the Launch Services database matches the input criteria.\n    at Error (native)\n\nShould error with fail to open: Error: Failed to open (-43)\n    at Error (native)\n```\n\nThere is no error stack if the error happened asynchronously so I'm probably doing something wrong there?\n\nThis isn't very relevant but that last example, LSGetApplicationForURL returns -43 error code if file (via file://) isn't found, but I couldn't find it anywhere in CoreFoundation or LaunchServices source anywhere, so might be a Finder error code. (Not part of standard error codes via [NSError](http://nshipster.com/nserror/) or [LaunchServices](https://developer.apple.com/reference/coreservices/1658613-launch_services#1661359).)\n"
