    "body": "I personally haven't used used `sendSync` before.  But just as a side opinionated point.\n\nUsing synchronous execution of code to block a user from interactions with the app seems like a bad plan.  Especially when printing to PDF is involved, imagine your user has a not so modern CPU and it takes a 5-10 seconds for the PDF to render, your app is completely unresponsive for that time and might even trigger the \"Window has stopped responding\" messages in Windows.\n\nTLDR:  You should probably use the asynchronous calls and block the user interacting with certain bits of the UI yourself\n"

I'm afraid this can not be fixed because of the natural of `ipc.sendSync`, I'll update the docs for this.\n"
