I think Electron has been doing a great job of tracking Chromium releases, given the amount of work involved in updating and testing everything as underlying APIs change, but many Electron apps don't display external web content so the stated \"day or two\" turnaround time may not be as important for the broader Electron community. I imagine this lag time will be a recurring issue, and it may be worth looking for a broader solution for Brave than just rushing the Chromum 50 update.\n"

Consider an Electron app opening PDF, media or even picture file from another person, oops, and Chromium had multiple known high vulnerabilities in PDFium (the pdf handling library), media, etc. Let's just pick some of them:\n\nHigh CVE-2016-1649: Buffer overflow in libANGLE. \nHigh CVE-2016-1645: Out-of-bounds write in PDFium. \nHigh CVE-2015-8126: Out-of-bounds access in libpng.\n\nIssues like this will continue to happen in the future. It's only a matter of time before someone sends a picture to Slack channel and BOOM, if you continue to think like this.\n\nDo not make excuses why you don't rebase. I don't think there is even any security goal here, or the team has seriously reviewed this.\n"

We feel that our current system of updating the Chromium component strikes an appropriate balance between the resources we have available and the needs of the majority of applications built on top of the framework. We definitely are interested in hearing more about specific use cases from the people that build things on top of Electron. I also believe that @diracdeltas brings up a good point that we should document and publish our security goals so that people considering Electron can make an informed decision. I'll be bringing this up in our next team meeting.\n\n@jsnar You have crossed the line from concerned citizen into trolling and personal attacks in violation of our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

    "body": "@diracdeltas This is why I want to stress the importance of my last sentence you left out of my quote. You are correct this is a big issue for programs like Slack or others that use third party content as \"trusted\". If Electron allows them to execute scripts in the node context it is game over. They have file system access and more. If nodeIntegration is disabled I still have concerns since Electron's security goals are not that of Chrome in order to make Electron work as intended. If the I's are not dotted and the T's are no crossed it could potentially be a very bad thing. This is why I think browsers built with Electron are a really bad idea and should be built off Chromium instead.\n\nElectron serves a very useful purpose. But if developers continue to misunderstand or misuse it they might as well straight up accept remote eval calls.\n"
