    "body": "When spell checking, `doesn` is first checked to be a wrong word, and then `doesn't` is checked to be correct, but somehow the mark is not removed after the check. In Chrome the word will not be checked when `'` is pressed, I think that is the difference that caused this problem.\n\nBefore this is fixed you can simply mark `doesn` as a correct word when spell checking to work around this.\n"
