    "body": "@bmcminn does the patch in #5029 get you what you need, or is just knowing whether the failure came from the main frame or a child frame not detailed enough for your case? If not, have you looked into the various `session.webRequest` handlers? http://electron.atom.io/docs/v0.37.4/api/session/#seswebrequest They’re more of a pain to work with, but also more detailed.\n\nThere's unfortunately not a lot more information available once we get to this point in the chromium side; no extra data about the request itself beyond what’s already provided is available. We probably could say more about which specific frame the error is coming from, but I don't think Electron really has a good way to expose that to the JS side.\n\nThat said I'm not by any means an expert in Electon or Chromium, so others might know better.\n"
