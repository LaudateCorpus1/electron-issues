    "body": "Okay just found out some more information!\n\nBasically if you set the titleBarStyle (even though the frame is set to false) it will show the titlebar all the time like the screenshots above. This is a bug as I think once frame is set to false, anything related to the frame such as traffic light buttons should be ignored.\n\nHowever there is still a slight issue (even when removing the titleBarStyle) as when you hover to the top to access the menu bar you see this:\n\n![screen shot 2015-12-16 at 00 41 50](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/801252/11828662/b8af8512-a38e-11e5-90cb-5d2c45b2f0c3.png)\n\nThis happens when frame is set to true and false. It should only appear if the frame is set to true when hovering. Setting the frame to be transparent however solves this as well, but these are all workarounds and not expected behaviour IMO.\n"
