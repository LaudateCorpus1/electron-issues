    "body": ">  Are these classes really meant to be an EventEmitter and should implement all these methods? Or are they just following the pattern, but don't have a desire to implement every method?\r\n\r\nThey should inherit directly from node's `EventEmitter`.\r\n\r\n> I didn't setup a demo repo, but I think it's pretty easy to recreate. Let me know if you need one.\r\n\r\nI'm having trouble reproducing this with `BrowserWindow` for example so can you provide a demo repo?\r\n\r\nThe prototype is set for this class here: https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/034230e2ae8c8ea5e52e955aa25400be64432d75/lib/browser/api/browser-window.js#L8"

    "body": "After looking at it more, I'm pretty sure this is a disconnect in @types versions. I've been using @types/electron v1.4.31 and @types/node v4.0.30. In @types/node v4.0.30, NodeJS.EventEmitter is an interface, not a class. After changing to @types/node v6.0.61, NodeJS.EventEmitter is a class. Do you know where I should be asking questions related to @types/electron, how it relates to @types/node, and the version of node I'm running? I tried in the electron slack channel, but didn't get any help there."
