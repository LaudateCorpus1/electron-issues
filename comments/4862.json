In old times of nw.js (the node-webkit age), the node integration was implemented by replacing Chromium's event event with libuv, which was quite buggy. I don't know how it goes now.\n"

While in Electron is 2 event loops in 2 different threads, when a function call is made from DOM to Node or vice versa, you have to do some thread synchronization thing like pausing one thread, or post the the function call into something like a queue and wait for the other thread to pick it up, which is inefficient.\n"
