What I did find was frontend JavaScript which in my naivety of Chromium internals is not what I'm looking for. I keep fumbling back to Brightray in browser/views/inspectable_web_contents_view_views.cc and thinking that when the dev tools is undocked there must be some kind of reinitialization of the design view that needs to take place so the main web view updates.\n\nObviously something is happening under the hood (in the Chromium bits) to make it work when the dev tools window is redocked so this one is weird to me.\n\nMaybe thinking strictly about DesignView is too limiting. Maybe there is something not being done when the dev tools is undocked. That has lead me to looking at devtools_window.cc. I'm still inspecting that to see if I can find anything of use.\n"

As soon as the dev tools window is docked the design view shows correctly again. I'm not sure adding the webcontents parameter to showDevTools would solve this because the dev tools window already knows about the web contents. I very well could be wrong. Is there any more information you could provide on that and it possibly solving this issue?\n\nI'm just a guy trying to wrangle issues and see if I can assist.
