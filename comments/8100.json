    "body": "I've been wrestling `window.open` issues for the past day and a half, all to attempt to get Google and other OAuth to work. I've tried with electron's `window.open` implementation, initially planning bridge sync calls like `window.opener.foo` via ipc with node-fibers.  Due to #9581 , that isn't an option. I also tried the new `nativeWindowOpen`, which is by far the most promising, but ran into this issue. After debugging my use case further I found something surprising... **the `window.opener` is correctly set when the page first loads `about:blank`, but gets lost when it loads the url supplied to the `BrowserWindow`** I'm curious if navigating from `about:blank` to another site is confusing chromiums security policy (as the `window.opener` would normally be unset when you change domains). //cc @kevinsawicki "
