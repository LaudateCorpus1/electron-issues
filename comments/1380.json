    "body": "I will take this issue. But before implementation, some details of the API design are needed to be disscussed. There are two options we can provide in Electron as far as I can see:\n- Option1: Align with Chromoium upstream way by implementing a `win.mainContents.chooseMediaList` API. The API will prompt a Chromium picker dialog to allow user choose which window/screen they want to share.\n  The API usage is illustrated as follows:\n\n``` javascript\nmainWindow.webContents.chooseDesktopMedia([\"screen\", \"window\"], function(error, desktopId) {\n  if (error) {\n    console.log('Desktop Capture access rejected.');\n    return;\n  }\n  navigator.webkitGetUserMedia({\n    audio: false,\n    video: {\n      mandatory: {\n        chromeMediaSource: 'desktop',\n        chromeMediaSourceId: desktopId,\n        minWidth: 1280,\n        maxWidth: 1280,\n        minHeight: 720,\n        maxHeight: 720\n      }\n    }\n  }, gotStream, getUserMediaError);\n});\n```\n- Option2: We don't implement the Chromium picker dialog in Electron side by providing a more details information for each captured window/screen. So the API is like:\n\n``` javascript\nvar screenCapture = win.webContents.getMediaList([\"window\", \"screen\"]);\n\nscreenCapture.on('source-add', function(item) {\n // item.name: the name of captured screen/window shown to the user\n // item.image: the thumbnail NativeImage of captured screen/window.\n // item.id: the id of captured screen/window used in navigator.webkitGetUserMedia \n if (item.name == 'Electron') {\n   navigator.webkitGetUserMedia({\n     audio: false,\n     video: {\n       mandatory: {\n         chromeMediaSource: 'desktop',\n         chromeMediaSourceId: item.id,\n         minWidth: 1280,\n         maxWidth: 1280,\n         minHeight: 720,\n         maxHeight: 720\n       }\n     }\n   }, gotStream, getUserMediaError);\n }\n});\n\nscreenCapture.on('source-change', function(item) {});\nscreenCapture.on('source-remove', function(item) {});\n```\n\nCompared to option 1, option 2 provides the possibility of custumization to users of Electron(They can do whaterver they need, e.g. implement a customized dialog, and select a fixed window in code). On the other side, user are benefited from the nice Chromium picker dialog in option 1, but they also loose customization in cost. \n\nWe would like to hear the feedbacks from users. Suggestions are welcomed :smile: \n"
