Instead of `accelerator`, maybe an `accelerators` option could be specified. An array where the first item is the key combo shown, and the rest are aliases.\n\nFor example:\n\n``` javascript\n{ label: 'Zoom In', accelerators: [ 'Command+Plus', 'Command+=' ] }\n```\n\nThe \"Zoom In\" scenario is a very common one on Mac OS X.\n"
