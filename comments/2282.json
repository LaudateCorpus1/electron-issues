Both of them ensure that the folder is open, but neither of them focus the folder window.\n\n(That means you might click, say, \"Open folder\" in an electron app. It calls `shell.openItem` or `showItemInFolder`. Either way, the folder is still at the bottom of a stack of windows and the user thinks nothing happened.) \n"
