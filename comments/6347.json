    "body": "For most GUI frameworks, the maximum/minimum size only constrains the actions of users, if developers set a maximum/minimum size and then break it themselves, the framework will not stop them.\n\nElectron is thin wrapper of the native GUI APIs on each platform for creating windows, that's why you see this behavior, Cocoa allows developers to break window's size constrains.\n\nAdding our own checks for `setSize` and other APIs is possible, but it adds code complexity and does not really follow the convention for GUI frameworks. So I think we should just follow operating system's default behaviors when developers break things themselves.\n\nI'm closing this as won't fix.\n"

    "body": "@zcbenz I get that we are just a thin wrapper over native GUI APIs but this is proving a rather annoying issue for us in automated testing.\n\nWe are using spectron and calling `setSize`; on Windows the test passes as the size is truncated at the minimum and max values.\n\nOn macOS it fails, this inconsistency is a bit annoying.  Can this be handled inside electron in anyway or do you think that test should be disabled on macOS?\n"
