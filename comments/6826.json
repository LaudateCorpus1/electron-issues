Here's the relevant text from [the docs](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd378397%28v=vs.85%29.aspx):\n\n> The contents of the Frequent and Recent categories are calculated for each application that uses SHAddToRecentDocs directly. In some cases of user action, such as opening a file through Windows Explorer or using the common file dialog box to open, save, or create a file, the Shell calls SHAddToRecentDocs on behalf of an application and those calls are also taken into account in the usage statistics. The Shell also calls SHAddToRecentDocs on behalf of the application when a destination is launched from its Jump List. However, it is good practice for the application to explicitly call SHAddToRecentDocs itself even if it is expected that the Shell will make the call. This guarantees that the usage is recorded, and the algorithms for tracking recent or frequent usage will correct for any duplicate calls.\n"

    "body": "@enlight great. one thing puzzles me though: we (VS Code) never could get the entries we added via `app.addRecentDocument` to show up in the task bar. Now, when I use the new `setJumpList` and add an empty category `recent`, they start to show up! This was driving me crazy and I spent hours over hours to find the bug on our end by checking if some Windows registry key was wrong or missing...\n\nOne thing I noticed is that the issue was caused by us calling `app.setUserTasks`. With the new `setJumpList` I am not using that call anymore and if I take it out completely (and also do not call `app.setJumpList`, the recent file entries start to show up.\n\nAnyhow, now with `setJumpList` it seems to work just fine 👍 \n"

Note that this doesn't mean that once removed an item can never be added back into the Jump List, Windows will clear the `removedItems` list after a successful call to `app.setJumpList()`, at which point you can call `app.setJumpList()` again to add the previously removed item back in.\n"
