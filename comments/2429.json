    "body": "I think the problem is not Electron setting window icon, actually if you do not set `icon` property, Electron will not set window icon. This is caused by Electron setting application user model ID, once it is set Windows will prefer to use the exe's icon, and the window icon would be ignored.\n\nRecent versions of Electron do not set application user model ID by default any more, so this should work now.\n"
