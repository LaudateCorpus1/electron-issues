While the title of the issue is somewhat relevant, the body of the issue is completely irrelevant:\n\n> When I use a webview and log in to a website (let's say github) it appears the session/cookie information is lost after restarting the application. Is there a way to enable this on the webview?\n\nThis issue describes ability to have multiple windows that have isolated sessions.\n"
