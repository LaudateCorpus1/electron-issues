    "body": "According to the https://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/prerender, implementing this in Electron would be very nasty, for example, it is hard to decide how should `will-navigate` event work for prerendering pages, we probably have to add a whole new set of APIs to support it without breaking existing apps.\n\nSo I'm closing this as won't fix since it gains us too little compared to the relatively large work.\n"
