    "body": "@zcbenz \nAre you aware of any reason why insecure content loaded over secure connection would prevent the content from being rendered in Electron? On web Chrome, I see the content as expected, with the console warning: \n\n> Mixed Content: The page at 'https://applicationURL.com/' was loaded over HTTPS, but requested an insecure image 'http://sfist.com/assets_c/2016/03/ttc_w-01-penrose-366-02_0-thumb-640xauto-937835.jpg'. This content should also be served over HTTPS.\n\nWhat I am experiencing: \n\nMy Electron app loads a web site. There can be insecure content in the website. Any non-ssl image is blocked by electron. But it is loaded in web. \n"
