Even if it's relatively hacky, it'd be better than not being able to input text. Conversely, being able to disable it completely would provide a way to work around it in the mean time.\n\nBecause it's a blocker for those that need the keyboard (where a hardware keyboard isn't possible or probable), is it worth re-classifying this @zcbenz?\n"

    "body": "After investigating some Electron and Chromium source-code i came up with the following facts:\n1) At the moment Electron has nothing to do with opening/closing the Keyboard\n2) Chromium calls the \"DisplayVirtualKeyboard\" function whenever a TouchGesture on a textfield is made\n3) The \"DisplayVirtualKeyboard\" can be found [here](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git/+/54.0.2816.1/ui/base/win/osk_display_manager.cc)\n4) Chromium does not support flags like --disable-virtual-keyboard or --force-virtual-keyboard\nThere is only a deprecated --enable-virtual-keyboard which does nothing\n\nSo my suggestion is to implement those two flags into chromium - and as soon as it hits the stable version integrate it into electron and add the needed flags to the electron config.\nThis probably would be the cleanest way at the moment.\n"
