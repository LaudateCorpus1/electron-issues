    "body": "This is 100% expected.\n\nBasically what you are doing is adding an event listener in the `main` process **from the renderer process**.  The `remote` module doesn't move the scope of the function call, it simply proxies the function call for you to the `main` process.  So when you add an event listener on `remote.ipcMain` you are effectively adding a listener in the main process which won't be removed like `ipcRenderer` ones would be when the `webContents` is deleted.\n\nIMO you should **never** use `remote.ipcMain` as it just doesn't make sense, the whole point of the names is you use `ipcMain` in the main process and `ipcRenderer` in the renderer process\n"
