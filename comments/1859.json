It definitely works selecting the first certificate from the store, but I was unable to get the command line switch to work how I would expect. Here's the code I was using:\n\n```\nvar app = require ('app');\napp.commandLine.appendSwitch ('client-certificate', process.cwd () + '\\\\mycertificate.p12');\nconsole.log (process.cwd () + \"\\\\mycertificate.p12\");\n```\n\nI did verify that the path to the certificate is correct. The p12 actually contains a password, which I'm guessing this method doesn't support, but I did do a .pem that does not have a password and I know works but still did not have any luck. Am I missing something?\n"

We normally create .p12 for our clients, which they just then install in the system certificate store and those work on all browsers. The .pem files are generated using the same method. Is there anything specific about the certificate that you want me to check or verify?\n"
