    "body": "Well, I used the win-mouse module to get the mouse position, on click down, and move the window accordingly, but when moving from one monitor to another, if the scaling was different between monitors, the window didn't follow the mouse on the second screen, unless I factored the values X,Y returned by win-mouse with scaling. Works fine if I input it manually to 1.5(when the scaling is 150% in Windows), but that's not a solution. \nHowever, there is no problem for scaling 125%, so I suppose that the fix mentioned in the other thread should also fix this. Hope it makes it to 1.3.6.\n"

    "body": "@andrewda You don't need a native module to get the mouse position.  If you think about it, when dragging your mouse will always be over the window.  You can implement code similar to this\n\n``` js\nimport { remote } from 'electron';\n\nlet wX;\nlet wY;\nlet dragging = false;\n\n$('.draggable').mousedown(function (e) {\n    dragging = true;\n    wX = e.pageX;\n    wY = e.pageY;\n});\n\n$(window).mousemove(function (e) {\n    e.stopPropagation();\n    e.preventDefault();\n    if (dragging) {\n        var xLoc = e.screenX - wX;\n        var yLoc = e.screenY - wY;\n\n        try {\n            remote.BrowserWindow.getFocusedWindow().setPosition(xLoc, yLoc);\n        } catch (err) {\n            console.log(err);\n        }\n    }\n});\n\n$(window).mouseup(function () {\n    dragging = false;\n});\n```\n\nExcuse the jQuery 😆 \n\nBut yeah, I've tested that on really slow machines moving the mouse stupidly fast and it has never failed me yet 👍 \n"
