    "body": "I agree with @hokein, this should be handled on the server side. In order to send an e-mail from a client, you'd need to specify a POP (or IMAP) server. And in order for a user's machine to be able to send via that e-mail server, it would need to be open to the world and basically without authentication (you'd need to configure this as well, so it would be readable by everyone).\n\nIn summary this is more complicated than simply configuring an a recipient e-mail address. Since this is non-trivial, and something I doubt the average Electron developer is looking for, I'm going to close this issue.\n"
