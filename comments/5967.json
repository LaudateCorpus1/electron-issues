    "body": "Hi @kevinsawicki,\nCorrect me if I'm misunderstanding something here (I'm a bit new to electron), but it seems to me that this PR doesn't necessarily close #5953, as advertised.  I'm still seeing the issues described by the reporter of that ticket.\n\nThe test that you added seems to prove that communication from parent to child is possible, but I don't see how it demonstrates child to parent communication, which is what #5953 is about.  If this PR really does allow the use of `window.opener` as stated in the description, it would be cool to see that asserted in the test.\n\nSpecifically, I'm observing is that, in the child document, window.opener is still null.  (using electron 1.2.6, which should certainly have this fix)\n"
