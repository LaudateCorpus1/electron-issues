We have a few window types (like the email composer) that really shouldn't be more than 800px wide or so, and it'd be nice for maximizing to stop there. \n\nAlso 👍  for handling the shift-option-click scenario... that's some seriously obscure Mac foo.\n\nCould we add a note to the docs to mention how the page width is determined? I'm actually not sure how Chrome computes the intrinsic width of the document.\n"
