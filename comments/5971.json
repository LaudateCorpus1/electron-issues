    "body": "@zcbenz  The current NW.js version I am using for my app is v0.12.3, which should be based on Chromium 41.0.2272.76, and yeah it's pretty old already (I haven't upgraded to v0.13+ yet due to some technical issues, another reason why I am considering moving to Electron).\n\nHardware acceleration is always on (my app uses a lot of canvas and WebGL stuff, so it has to be on anyways).\n\nI tested my app on older versions of Electron. The problem was still there on v1.2.1 and v1.1.3. I didn't test all versions, and the last one I tested was v1.0.1. Suprisingly, v1.0.1 worked fine with tooltip displayed properly without GPU lockup. I guess it may have something to do with the Chromium version?\n\nAs mentioned in the first post, the problem is gone if BrowserWindow is non-transparent.\n\nNot sure if it's related, but newer versions of Electron crashed my app sometimes (ie. everything on the Electron window disappeared after app startup, though this totally transparent window was still occupying screen space with mouse blocking etc), especially with IFRAME and some WebGL animations. This NEVER happened before on NW.js, and so far not on v1.0.1 as well.\n"

    "body": "@zcbenz I have filed the bug report to Chromium's side, but anyways after some testings, I have managed to figure out the simplest steps to reproduce the problem. I suppose these information may be useful to you.\n\n1) Open an Electron (Chromium 50+) window in transparent mode.\n\n2) Open a page with some elements that contain the \"title\" attribute.\n\n3) Resize the window after page load (using something like window.resizeBy(640,480)).\n\n4) Move the cursor around the page so that those tooltips are shown. At certain point, the GPU usage will suddenly rise noticeably.\n\nAttached is a simple app that can reproduce the problem.\n[app.zip](https://github.com/electron/electron/files/321000/app.zip)\n"
