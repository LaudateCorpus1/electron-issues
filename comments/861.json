    "body": "Similar issue on CEF https://code.google.com/p/chromiumembedded/issues/detail?id=1161\n\nOld Chromium issue: https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=361235\n\nSome old Chromium commits for this issue: https://codereview.chromium.org/124553002/\n\nWhat follows below is a naive attempt to hand jam libchromiumcontent to change that god awful white background color...\n\nThis isn't a complete answer to this issue but for people that may want to get their hands dirty I have successfully changed the background color of the Electron window for Windows by editing the native_window_views.cc file. In the NativeWindowViews constructor I added the following:\n\nAt line 320 where #if defined(OS_WIN) is defined I added this:\n\n``` cpp\nHBRUSH brush = ::CreateSolidBrush(RGB(255, 0, 0));\n::SetClassLongPtr(GetAcceleratedWidget(), GCLP_HBRBACKGROUND, (LONG)brush);\n```\n\nThis changes the background to red. Now when I start Electron's default app and resize it I see a red background as the Chrome content window tries to keep up with the resize. \n\nIf this works for some people a command line switch could be exposed to allow this to be changed. I think that'd be the simplest way to hack this in for those wanting to get their hands dirty. And for those providing their own custom binaries that don't mind having hacks in. \n\nIf anyone is willing could you investigate similar ways to do this for Linux/Mac maybe even within the native_window_views.cc. \n\nAside from doing this in Electron's code it can also be done from Chromium if need be. I'm sure similar techniques can be employed.\n\nAdditionally, Electron's default app loads too fast on my machine so I cannot see a red background as the app is loading. Does anyone have a sample Electron app that can simulate a very slow loading app that can cause the Chromium content window to load slowly so the background shows like in the animated gif above?\n\nEDIT 1:\n\nActually my hack doesn't work totally, I just checked my own app (instead of the Electron default app). I suspect this will need to be patched in Chromium because the content window will still show white while the Electron window will be changed.\n\nI'm investigating Chromium's code: chromium\\src\\ui\\gfx\\win\\window_impl.cc as a test to see if this is where the change needs to happen. There are similar files for Linux and Mac.\n\nEDIT 2:\n\nChanging this in chromium\\src\\ui\\gfx\\win\\window_impl.cc seems to be out of the question, doesn't work. I'm looking at chromium\\src\\content\\browser\\renderer_host\\render_widget_host_view_base.cc now. I don't know if this will be it either. Throw me a bone guys, LOL!\n\nEDIT 3:\n\nchromium\\src\\content\\browser\\renderer_host\\render_widget_host_view_base.cc doesn't seem to work either. I'll try again tomorrow. We have to isolate exactly which window the content window is and then set the background color there. This is fun! LOL!\n\nEDIT 4:\n\nI've had some minor success with heavy handed libchromiumcontent hacking but it doesn't seem to be as cut and dry as it sounds. If anyone wants details please let me know.\n"

    "body": "I got this bright idea to call insertCSS on the browser window before loadUrl but that doesn't work because apparently webContents is not initialized or if it is the insertCSS is ignored. This can be best illustrated by just commenting out your LoadUrl in your main.js and what you'll see is a nice white background. You can open Dev tools and see a whole lot of nothing in any of the tabs. No ability to inspect the underlying content if there is any (which I suspect there isn't). \n\nI can certainly hand jam libchromiumcontent to make the background any color but this doesn't work universally (yet as I have not isolated every place the background of the window is set, there are a lot), for instance when resizing a page that has a webview you'll still see a white background. I've spent 8 hours today looking into this. LOL!\n\nAdditionally I've updated my last post to this issue and added some corresponding Chromium and CEF patches.\n\nFor those wanting to try their luck at this, this site is invaluable for searching Chromium's code:\n\nhttps://code.google.com/p/chromium/codesearch\n\nUpdate 1: \n\nOkay so I finally had some success with resizing webviews and possibly other elements and getting rid of the white background. I hard coded the background_color_ to be SK_ColorBLACK in  chromium/src/cc/layers/layer.cc in libchromiumcontent and now the white is replaced with black.\n\nHere is some progress, in my case I need a black background. The flash at the beginning is not a white background even though it may look like it. I've inspected the individual frames of the gif as the window opened up. This is all hard coded into libchromiumcontent now so nothing able to be exposed yet to Electron.\n\nGetting this far required changing a few files to get all the white backgrounds changed. I'm still working on this and am adding a command line switch override to libchromiumcontent. Hopefully I can document all of the involved files soon but this is still a work in progress.\n\nNOTE: To be honest I'm having a tough time reproducing this on a clean libchromiumcontent. I've changed so much today that I don't know every file I've changed. It's going to take a little more work to figure this out unfortunately.\n\n![electron-resize-no-white](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/190154/8921967/c033cca6-34aa-11e5-8c0e-62f1e1b9a8c6.gif)\n\nUpdate 2:\n\nJust to recap this issue as far as Chromium goes. One hurdle to solve this is that Chromium hard codes Sk_ColorWHITE for a lot of backgrounds in the various components. Plus there are other areas of the code that don't use the SkColor.h. There is also at least one other header file that defines base colors used.\n\nTake some of what I wrote above with a grain of salt, in other words what I wrote is not fully correct and I will try to provide some clarity soon. Yesterday I changed so much code in libchromiumcontent that I totally lost track of all my changes and now cannot reproduce what I have in my animated gif above. I'm working on it though. What I'm attempting to do in the short term as far as Electron goes is expose a new command line switch to override the base background color. This is the path of least resistance as far as an API goes and allows me to focus on the problem which is that god awful white background color. LOL!\n"

    "body": "There are multiple issues going on here. I've been looking at this for quite a long time. This particular comment isn't going to talk about the white window on app load although I am still looking into that one and have spent 10's of hours on it. This comment is a continuation of that. In my app I use a webview and the webview creates an object inside of it within a shadow-root. This object is white and when resizing will expose that gawd awful white window as the webview object tries to keep up with the resize. This object cannot be styled so you cannot just set it's background color, similarly I have not been able to select this object using jQuery. Seems the shadow-root is well.... shadowed, LOL!\n\nOn a whim I was like lets just make that object inside the webview an iframe instead of an object because I could then set it's background color to whatever I wanted. So I hacked web-view.coffee to do that. Everything still seems to function correctly, I can set the background color of that iframe inside the webview, pass along the webview src and all is well. Now resizing the window will show the color I want instead of the nasty white. Here is where I need a sanity check. Is there a specific reason the object inside the webview is an object? I mean, I made it an iframe and my app functions perfectly fine. It's not violating the sandboxing, eg. It's not getting node integration because of this change. It's still safely tucked away in that shadow-root inside the webview for which I have not enabled node-integration. No errors in the console, functionality is the same. Life is good. Is this insane? Can anyone comment on this?\n\nJust to clarify a point, I did not actually set the iframe's background color, I set the webview's background color which the iframe inherits.\n\nUPDATE #1: By doing what I mentioned above you lose webview's custom API's. eg. preload doesn't work, no events get fired etc... This may or may not be desirable for your app.\n"

This gets us some of the way there but does not address the white window flash when everything is loading up. This does appear to help alleviate the white on resize issue. We'll need a way for users to specify their own custom color though. We'll need a way to translate a nice hex color string to the appropriate value for passing to this function. Additionally this uses Chrome code so should work on Linux and Mac. I only tested on Windows.\n\n``` cpp\n// Here we just hard code the background to black to see if we can gain some control over the \n// elusive white window showing on resize. \nweb_view_->set_background(views::Background::CreateSolidBackground(0xFF000000));\n```\n\nThere are still some white issues remaining but I'm hoping to track down the rest of them soon.\n"
