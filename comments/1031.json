    "body": "Come to think of it, there's an interesting situation here:\n1. Official node, which is 0.10.x, uses a really old V8\n2. _Everything else_ (atom-shell, node-webkit, iojs, Chrome itself) uses current V8\n3. Most of the native modules are written against the old V8 API, hence _only_ work in node\n4. Some native modules, like node-sqlite3, _can_ work with current V8 but only if you use the node-webkit specific build tool (nw-gyp)\n\nWe've got to find a way to fix this!\n"
