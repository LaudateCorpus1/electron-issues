    "body": "Just curious, how hard would it be to improve the current API to support audio? @hokein, I know you did the first (awesome) iteration on desktopCapturer at #2963, which back then didn't support audio. I wanted to hear your thoughts (: I would _love_ this feature to work on electron.\n\nBy the way, I'm unable to obtain the audio of the screen through the `chromeMediaSource: 'screen'` method. Can you provide a sample `getUserMedia` constraint that captures the audio and video of a screen, or give a hint to point me into the right direction? I tried the following constraint but I got `NavigatorUserMediaError: {name: \"ScreenCaptureError\", message: \"\", constraintName: \"\"}`:\n\n```\n{\n    audio: true,\n    video: {\n        mandatory: {\n            chromeMediaSource: 'screen'\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n Thanks again!\n"
