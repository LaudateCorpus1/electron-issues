It will take me a bit to build up a stripped down app, but I've created a [gist of the standalone script](https://gist.github.com/robwilkerson/00481a56a730015beaae) I can execute via `$ node modem-request`\n\nWill follow up with an example app as quickly as possible.\n"

    "body": "The simplest case almost always works. In this case, it was a real PITA to create that simple case from where I am now, but it surely helped me see that Electron wasn't the problem. My app required a separate module that, in turn, required the `request-promise` library which seems to reset the original parser. Once I removed that include, the new parser worked nicely.\n\nThanks for the push.\n"
