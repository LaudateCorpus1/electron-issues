I would much rather see an _actual_ fix to the mentioned problems instead of reverting per-monitor DPI awareness. IMO the user experience without per-monitor DPI awareness is worse than a window placement bug."

If we don't want to revert and continue investigation on higher priority, i'm good with it. If we can't get a fix out by next release, we should consider reverting the change to unblock people to move to latest electron. @kevinsawicki your thoughts?"
