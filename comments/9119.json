    "body": "Electron just calls into Chromium's API to capture the screen, I'm not sure why there is any difference, maybe it is related to Chrome versions?\r\n\r\nAnyway to find out why it happened requires debugging into Chromium's desktop capturing code, which we do not have resources to do, so I'm closing this as won't fix."

    "body": "@zcbenz, the problem according screen sharing is known issue for whole world, here you have nothing to do. My issue mostly relates to question: why chrome by default is using built-in GPU, and electron app - external? I believe the root of this is part of framework."
