    "body": "Well, it seems that there is no black screen issue for me anymore. It took me to rewrite the whole application to figure out the issue.\n\nFirst of all the app architecture is quite important if this is a multi-window app (like in my case).\nBut most importantly, after I've updated `electron-prebuilt` to version a `0.37.2` I forgot to change `--version` option in my build script. [Referring](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-packager#opts) to docs, this option is not required, but still.\n\nSo now, build scripts look like this:\n\n``` json\n\"scripts\": {\n    \"start\": \"electron app.js\",\n    \"build-darwin\": \"electron-packager . appname --platform=darwin --arch=x64 --version=0.37.2 --ignore=node_modules/electron-*\",\n    \"build-win32\": \"electron-packager . appname --platform=win32 --arch=x64 --version=0.37.2 --ignore=node_modules/electron-*\"\n}\n```\n\nApp builds work well on both MacOSX & Windows 10.\n"
