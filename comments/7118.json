It'd be nice to use `webContents` without needed to call `event.preventDefault` first on the renderer.\n\nIf this change were made behind a security flag, would it be acceptable? Does it seem rational to have renderer processes leverage `event.setData` this way?\n"

    "body": "An issue I'm encountering while attempting to implement this API is that [WebDragData's stringData member](https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/third_party/WebKit/public/platform/WebDragData.h?type=cs&sq=package:chromium&rcl=1474485509&l=66) is only a string. When calling into `dataTransfer.setData('any/type', ['some string', 'array'])`, V8 joins the strings with a comma into a single string, and ultimately stashes it in `stringData`. (This happens in V8 [near this code](https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/out/Debug/gen/blink/bindings/core/v8/V8DataTransfer.cpp?type=cs&sq=package:chromium&l=215), converting array into `V8StringResource`)\n\nI could split on commas, but if a user tries to pass in a file with a comma in it, it would break for multiple files. Pretty crappy.\n\nWith our private patch, we were using a special string to separate file paths. ( `c:\\path1||FOO||c:\\path2`). I was hoping to implement a cleaner API here, but it seems I'm blocked from using an array type in `setData`.\n\nAny recommendations?\n\nP.S.

    "body": "I haven't forgotten about this!\n\nRevisiting it briefly today, I can imagine two solutions:\n\n1) Using a magic string:\n\n``` js\nfunction dragstart_handler(ev) {\n  ev.dataTransfer.setData(\n    \"electron/file-paths\", \n    'C:\\\\path1\\\\kitten.jpg' + MAGIC_SEPARATOR + 'C:\\\\path2\\kitten2.jpg'\n  );\n}\n```\n\nTo recap the reasoning for the above solution, this is due to V8 only accepting strings, and not arrays, for `setData`. This solution could be prettied up:\n\n``` js\nfunction dragstart_handler(ev) {\n  const paths = electron.pathHelper([path1, path2]);\n  ev.dataTransfer.setData(\"electron/file-paths\", paths);\n}\n```\n\nOr perhaps we could use JSON.stringify, and parse the JSON string within chromium.\n\n2) Use `ipcRenderer.sendSync`:\n\n``` js\nfunction dragstart_handler(ev) {\n  const idx = ipcRenderer.sendSync('magicDragEventName', ['/path/one.jpg', '/path/two.jpg']);\n  ev.dataTransfer.setData(\"electron/file-paths\", idx);\n}\n```\n\n`magicDragEventName` could store the path data in a static object, which then can be accessed by the necessary chromium code. This seems more complicated.\n\nAny thoughts or suggestions? The magic string solution seems simplest, but I hate having to resort to such a clumsy approach. However, without being able to communicate an array within the renderer thread synchronously, these are the only solutions that come to mind.\n"
