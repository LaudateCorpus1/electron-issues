    "body": "Not all window managers support hints like this, and some expect `_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_DOCK` while some expect `_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE`, so for implementing the dock feature I doubt setting `_NET_WM_STRUT` would be enough.\r\n\r\nI suggest working out a demo C program that implements docking yourself, and if it really works, we can integrate it into Electron.\r\n\r\nClosing since it is a much larger task than it sounds, and the team does not have enough resources to study into it."
