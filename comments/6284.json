You might be able to, however, embed whatever you have embedded in an OS X webview in an Electron webview, though you would need to swap any and all native APIs you were accessing from the OS X webview for Electron APIs.\n\nIn the future, for questions on writing apps, I suggest seeking help from [the community](https://github.com/electron/electron#community). The issues list is only for bug reports and feature requests.\n"
