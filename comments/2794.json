I guess i need to define required menu items, and then, set the menu bar accordingly.\n\nOn a side note, with the same code on `OS X`, I can't make the window fullscreen using the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl-Cmd-F`, as expected.\n\n``` javascript\nmainWindow = new BrowserWindow({\n     width: 480,\n     height: 640,\n     resizable: false,\n     fullscreen: false,\n});\n```\n\nHowever, on Linux/Windows, it behaves differently.\n\nLooks like there is some inconsistent behavior with respect to setting `fullscreen` option to `false`.\n"

I think that's a typo due to confusion with  [`app.dock.setMenu()`](http://electron.atom.io/docs/v0.32.0/api/app/) (someone correct me if I'm wrong?).\n\nRight, the entire menu was gone. Sorry if I wasn't clear enough -- there's a menu item with a keyboard command bound to it by default. So, removing the menu removes the keyboard command. You're right that you'll want to set up your own menu bar (or remove it if you so desire).\n\nDunno what to tell you about `Ctrl+Cmd+F`. :-\\\n"
