You can use it to only verify that the docs are well-formatted:\n\n```\nelectron-docs-linter docs/api\n\nDocs are good to go! 👍\n```\n\nOr if you specify a version and a pipe, the generated JSON schema will be output:\n\n```\nelectron-docs-linter docs/api --version=1.2.8 > docs/api.json\n```\n\nIf the docs are not ship-shape, you'll see errors and the process exits with code of `1`:\n\n```\n❯ node cli.js ../../electron/electron/docs/api\n\n🙊  uh-oh! bad docs 🙈\n\n-----------------------\nfile: app.md\ntype: argument subproperties\npattern: /<code>(\\w+)<\\/code>\\s*(?:<a href.*>)?([a-zA-Z0-9\\[\\]]+)(?:<\\/a>)?(?: - )?(.*)/\nhtml: <code>%APPDATA%</code> on Windows\nmarkdown (approximate): `%APPDATA%` on Windows\n-----------------------\n... etc\n```\n\nThis gives us some flexibility. We can choose to use the linter in `electron/electron` purely as a linter, only to tell us that docs are good to go, OR we could use it to lint and generate the JSON schema to be included as a GitHub Release artifact.\n\nIn either case, this still needs some work as there are currently 100+ formatting errors remaining to fix.\n\n@zcbenz would you prefer to adapt the `upload.py` script to zip and upload the generated JSON, or would you prefer to just lint, and leave the schema generation to a separate project outside of `electron/electron`?\n"
