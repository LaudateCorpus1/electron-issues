    "body": "Just a tip: if you're having problems with atom-shell not even ~~loading~~ starting, try\n- starting from the command line. this way you get a little bit of output and can probably find out whats going on\n- or if you just want to test little snippets, do it in the devtools-console\n\nBTW, about your issue: I think you always had to `require('screen')` since you want atom-shells screen module not chromiums Screen. (**edit:** but I never used it, so I'm not 100% sure.)\n\n(**edit**: Also 0.20.3 !== latest ; but it doesn't matter in that case)\n"
