    "body": "I'm not porting a web app - the server I create (inside Electron) utilizes Socket.io to connect apps in a traditional web browser with my Electron interface. In other words, my Electron app is a remote debugging tool connected to other client apps.\n\nUsing `forever` allowed me to restart the app after setting changes automatically - which worked fine locally, but after running a custom build of Electron with my app I saw all sorts of funky problems (namely an infinite loop creating child processes).\n\nAs I understand things, creating a vanilla \"child process\" works fine -- it just doesn't inherit some of the parent process' environmental naunces (namely these Electron-specific node modules).\n\nI've tried all of the following variations as well, to no avail:\n\n```\n    var app = child.fork(\n        '_launch.js',\n        process.execArgv,\n        {\n            cwd : __dirname,\n            env : process.execPath\n            //env : process.env\n            //env : { \"ATOM_SHELL_INTERNAL_RUN_AS_NODE\" : \"0\" }\n        }\n    );\n```\n\nAll give me the same problems, though using `process.execPath` throws a different error:\n- App threw an error when running [TypeError: Cannot assign to read only property 'ATOM_SHELL_INTERNAL_RUN_AS_NODE'\n\nAsking the user to manually restart the app isn't the end of the world -- but I still don't see why this shouldn't be possible.\n"
