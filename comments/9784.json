    "body": "@zeke I think it should contain the top-level README as well. Currently, two (or more) different READMEs can be found in the translations (e.g. the [Indonesian](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs-translations/id/README.md) (?) and the [Italian](https://github.com/electron/electron/tree/master/docs-translations/it-IT) translation contain different READMEs.) Personally, I believe unifying the READMEs would make more sense, considering that there already translations for some languages available and the new translation projects in Crowdin would make it a lot more manageable anyway, but I can see why they're separated right now. As far as I can see, the top-level README contains general information, whereas the other one contains mostly links containing further information.\r\n\r\nAs for the Contributor Covenant, I think linking to the homepage is a great idea. Why copy text when there's already a website available that contains all available translations?"
