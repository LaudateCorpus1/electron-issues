I rebuilt the default app with the button below (in `default_app.js`), but it won't show up in the touch bar. Maybe some special image format/size is required? I could just find \"2x with a maximum height of 30 points (corresponding to 60 pixels)\" [in these docs](https://developer.apple.com/reference/appkit/nstouchbar#2647104).\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst imageButton = new (TouchBar.Button)({\r\n    image: path.join(__dirname, 'myimage@2x.png'),\r\n    click: () => {\r\n        console.log('my image clicked');\r\n    }\r\n});\r\n```"
