A recent VB update produced a pointer position regression in Ubuntu, and I wouldn't be surprised if the Guest Additions fix in that link resolved this too.\n\n@zcbenz - do you have a reason to suspect Chromium rather than VirtualBox? My money would be on the latter, just because I've experienced some long-standing (but tolerable) display problems here, such as not being able to screenshot from inside a VM - results are all black).\n\nEdit: I bet [this is the same](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=606764) as well, and [this one](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=608794) explicitly suspects VB bugs.\n"
