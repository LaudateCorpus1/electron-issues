    "body": "This is an error related to another dependency (probably of xml-stream), node-expat. This module is compiled against an older version of electron, hence the error.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking this error means that a native c++ module is compiled against a different version of electron. I'm closing this since this is not an electron bug."
