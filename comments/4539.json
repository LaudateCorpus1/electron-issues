    "body": "The source of the problem seems to be selection and/or focus related. The IME position is anchored to the host page's selection or activeElement, which is generally the `<body>`. Because `<webview>`s have their own content window, they each maintain their own selection ([example](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5355/19023234/6b090cde-88b7-11e6-9faf-db21b03fb98a.png)) and this seems to confuse Chrome.\n\nI encountered this issue when building the Basecamp 3 app (we use a lot of emoji) and worked around it by ensuring the active `<webview>` is the only view with a selection. In hopes of pushing this issue forward, I've put together an example app that demonstrates the problem and includes my workaround: https://github.com/javan/electron-webview-ime-fix. \n\nHopefully the Chromium team will fix things up. In the meantime, perhaps Electron could build in a similar fix? \n"
