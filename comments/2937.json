While Chrome is more accurate. After testing, [node-website-scraper] is really unable to obtain accurate. In addition, if the electron already has all the data in the site (in debug mode has been able to see the picture CSS JS and HTML even if it is off the network state), then why again use the crawler to get? Chrome should not use the crawler to complete the ctrl+s.\n"
