    "body": "I found the issue. I was executing a child process and it so happens that the call to start the child process was a sendSync which due to some still unknown reason was getting executed twice thus leading to a memory leak. I used a flag to limit it to a single execution for now (bad hack). \n\nSorry for the trouble. And I had send you a mail yesterday regarding making modification's to chrome src please have a look at the same.\n\nThanks\n"
