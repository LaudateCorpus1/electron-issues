    "body": "Hi teleclimber,\n\nI think the problem you're running into is that the `window-all-closed` event handler (here: https://github.com/dougnukem/hello-atom/blob/master/hello-app/main.js#L12) is firing and quitting the application immediately after the last window is closed. You should be able to keep your application running on Windows/Linux by disabling that event handler.\n"
