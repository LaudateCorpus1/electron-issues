    "body": "Just because the line is logged out does not mean that the operation is not blocking it just means that it doesn't immediately synchronously block.\n\nA pattern that has developed among Electron apps is to use a worker window to do these kind of tasks. Generally it is a hidden window that performs CPU intensive tasks. You can then send `ipc` events to the worker window by proxying it through the main process.\n\nThis question is probably better suited to StackOverflow or similar.\n"
