    "body": "This looks like a Chrome rendering bug to me, and I'm closing this since Electron uses Chromium's rendering code directly and we are not able to fix this on our side.\n\nI'm afraid your best choice is to try to reproduce this with Chrome bowser and then report it to Chromium's issues list, or you can just wait and see if next Chrome upgrade would fix this.\n"
