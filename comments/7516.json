    "body": "You should use the Dev Tools Profiler to investigate where the time is being spent on load, https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/profiles\n\nProfiling startup will let you know where the time is being spent. Without knowing where the time is spent, it is hard to know whether it is load time or the execution time of the file causing the slowdown in your case.\n\nElectron has built-in [require](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html) support so you aren't required to bundle your entire app into a single file, you can separate it into multiple files and load them as needed to get startup time down to a acceptable value.\n\nI'm going to close this out here, you might want to check out the [Electron forums](https://discuss.atom.io/c/electron) for help as well.\n"

    "body": "> Are you seriously implying there is nothing wrong with Electron taking 10 seconds to load a 500kB script?\n\nI think this is a really unfair assessment of Electron's performance. Keep in mind you are not loading a minimal application compiled to native code. You are loading an application that loads Chromium and Node.js to load _your_ application. Expect a slight bottle neck that would be impossible to resolve.\n\nAnd to echo @kevinsawicki, without knowledge of your code base there is really nothing to gauge the source of the issue. You can write severely unoptimized and memory intensive code in only a handful of lines. Which isn't a fault to Electron but could be at fault of how Chromium, Node.js or even V8 handles it.\n"

    "body": "@kevinsawicki @LrsNate \n\nYou are using `electron-compile` which transpiles code for you live on page load.  The first load takes 10 seconds as it has to transpile everything and then subsequent loads are fast because `electron-compile` uses a caching mechanism.\n\nUsing webpack and `electron-compile` together simply makes your load time stupidly long, choose one or the other.  Not both 👍 \n"
