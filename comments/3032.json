    "body": "Some thoughts:\n- I think the default behavior when running without `--enable-logging` should be to not output any logs including errors, but still output `console.*` calls. The reason is that the error logs are not really informative. For example on Linux a lot of users (maybe all) get the SUID sandbox message (see screenshot at #1482). It seems pointless to show this info to app users, and developers can run with `--enable-logging` to see it.\n  For Windows we'll need to find a way to dynamiclly set the destination. So `console.*` will print and other direct calls to `LOG` won't print (logging_dest set to none).\n- On Windows, `console.*` calls from renderers are printed to devtools and to cmd. I think it makes more sense that the render calls will print to the devtools console only, and main calls will print to cmd.\n- On Windows, `console.*` calls that are printed to cmd, start with an ugly prefix (e.g. `[11188:1009/211327:INFO:CONSOLE(0)] Some text`). The prefix is due to the usage of Chromium's logging mechanism. It seems it's printed by `LogMessage::Init`. Can we override that during calls to `console.*`? If not, can we just copy the relevent parts and print the calls without a prefix. It really looks weird that when you run `electron --help` or `electron --version` the output includes that prefix.\n\nWhat do you think?\n"

    "body": "I'm :+1: on all of them, the purpose of introducing `--enable-logging` was exactly to disable Chromium's logging by default and only print `console.log` outputs in the main process.\n\nOn Windows the way Node implemented `process.stdout` and `console.log` doesn't work well in Electron, so we redirected them to use Chromium's logging system, that's why we have this issue and #2390, we need to fix that to solve all the problems.\n\n> I think the default behavior when running without --enable-logging should be to not output any logs including errors\n\nChromium hard-coded the logging system to always output `ERROR` logs, we have to patch Chromium to fix this.\n"
