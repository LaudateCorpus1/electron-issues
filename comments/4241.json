Using this issue as an example, at least Atom and Slack do not have the problem, and non of other Electron apps has reported similar issue before, so I think it is safe to assume the problem is on your side.\n\nHave you installed your app into Program Files? And is there any other shortcut link pointing to your app? The rule for deciding the icon and name of a program on taskbar is not transparent, but generally Windows will try to use the information from exe files and shortcut links that have the same app user model ID, and you can right click on the task menu to find out the file that decides the name of the item.\n\n<img width=\"306\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-01-28 at 11 36 08 am\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/639601/12634317/6539458e-c5b3-11e5-8e5f-d6bf07b5583a.png\">\n<img width=\"380\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-01-28 at 11 36 18 am\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/639601/12634322/6a28a198-c5b3-11e5-8b7c-128d833f3fbc.png\">\n"

    "body": "@iiegor Just wanted to let you know what worked for me. I was not using Squirrel to test my application either and could never get the taskbar name to modify correctly. This was occuring even after I had set all of the proper options for windows (like ProductName, etc). Windows 10 seems to remember the name of the taskbar item based on where your application folder is located in Program Files. Once I changed the name of the folder containing my .exe, Windows allowed me to pin to taskbar with the correct name.\n\nJust a note: I also right clicked and did \"Pin to Start\" but I'm not sure if that made a difference. Hope this helps you out.\n"
