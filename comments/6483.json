    "body": "## Conclusion\n\n(I'm gonna describe my problem in case anyone else in the future is also having this issue and stumbles upon this. No one should ever relate to [this](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/wisdom_of_the_ancients.png))\n\nSo I had 2 windows, `splashScreen` and `contentWindow`. When a button in `splashScreen` was clicked, it would call `createContentWindow()` which would construct `contentWindow` with the `show` property set to `false`, set the menu bar to `null`, and then, if the app was running in debug mode, open the dev tools.\n\nThe content window would perform it's `window.onload` work, then send a message back to main process saying it was done. Then the main process would call `contentWindow.show()` and `splashScreen.close()`.\n\n**The problem:** It seems that calling `contentWindow.openDevTools()` before `contentWindow.show()` was the issue. When I moved the offending line to the right place, I was able to successfully run my app 30 times in a row. Given my earlier data that 4 in 30 trials failed, there is a 98.6% chance that this is the reason I was having issues.\n\n@zcbenz This issue has been resolved!\n"
