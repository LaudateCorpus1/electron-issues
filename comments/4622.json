    "body": "Hey folks! I implemented the drag-and-drop behavior referenced above in N1, and we've definitely noticed that you can't drag to other apps in all scenarios. It seems like the drag session is being created with a \"file promise\" (here's a mime-type. Do you want it? If you accept this drop, I'll give you data) rather than a \"file reference\" (here's a file, do you want it?). \n\n(I don't know the proper system names for these concepts unfortunately, but I think that's the distinction.)\n\nI think the first step might be to inspect the drag-and-drop pasteboard data coming from Chromium using a tool like https://pmougin.wordpress.com/2008/03/23/inspecting-the-pasteboard-with-drop-inspector/ to identify what is missing / different. This /might/ be very hard to change, but it's also possible that a few lines of NodObjC could extend the pasteboard data in-flight and make the drop work.\n"

    "body": "@zcbenz I'm evaluating using Electron for a new project and this feature is a requirement for us. I looked at the current version of the code but didn't see the API being implemented yet. I'd be glad to give it a try if you could point me in the right direction.\n\nI'm looking at the chromium implementation:\n\n``` c++\nvoid DragDownloadItem(const content::DownloadItem* download,\n                      gfx::Image* icon,\n                      gfx::NativeView view) {\n\n  // Set up our OLE machinery\n  ui::OSExchangeData data;\n\n  drag_utils::CreateDragImageForFile(\n      download->GetFileNameToReportUser(),\n      icon ? icon->AsImageSkia() : gfx::ImageSkia(),\n      &data);\n\n  base::FilePath full_path = download->GetTargetFilePath();\n  std::vector<ui::FileInfo> file_infos;\n  file_infos.push_back(\n      ui::FileInfo(full_path, download->GetFileNameToReportUser()));\n  data.SetFilenames(file_infos);\n\n  aura::Window* root_window = view->GetRootWindow();\n  if (!root_window || !aura::client::GetDragDropClient(root_window))\n    return;\n\n  gfx::Point location = display::Screen::GetScreen()->GetCursorScreenPoint();\n  aura::client::GetDragDropClient(root_window)->StartDragAndDrop(\n      data,\n      root_window,\n      view,\n      location,\n      ui::DragDropTypes::DRAG_COPY | ui::DragDropTypes::DRAG_LINK,\n      ui::DragDropTypes::DRAG_EVENT_SOURCE_MOUSE);\n}\n```\n\nI'm not sure about a few things:\n- how do these classes map to Electron, can we just import and start using?\n- where should we do the integration? I think for safety reason we don't want to change the default drag and drop behavior so we would need to expose a new API. What's the machinery do that?\n\nAs mentioned, I'd be glad to help but I do need some guidance.\n"
