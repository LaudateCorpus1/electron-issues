    "body": "I'm getting these pretty frequently on a /somewhat/ complex webapp inside beaker, the editor app. It's served over a custom standard protocol (beaker://editor/) which is handled as via http responses (registerHttpProtocol). The frontend of the app uses workers, but the crash happens so fast on navigation to beaker://editor/ sometimes, Im not convinced the workers ever get involved.\r\n\r\nReproducing will be a pain. It's happening on around 1 out of 30 navigations."
