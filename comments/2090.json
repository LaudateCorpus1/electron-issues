It's taking me a while to ramp up on the system anyway :)  Can you include me in the PR?\n\nA few things to call out:\n- make sure you link to `comctrl32.lib` (I didn't see any references to it)\n- you need to update the app manifest file to include [comctrl32 v6](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb773175%28v=vs.85%29.aspx?f=255&MSPPError=-2147217396), otherwise you'll get an error saying you're using the wrong version. \n\n**Side note:** if you're going to update the manifest file, you should also add that the app is [dpiaware](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dn469266%28v=vs.85%29.aspx?f=255&MSPPError=-2147217396) (go to the section called _Declaring DPI Awareness_).
