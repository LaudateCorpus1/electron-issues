However to get rid of the old cache, perhaps you could have a move old cache directory on startup if it exists. Then you get to clean up users systems while keeping old cache at the same time, if that's desirable."

Local Storage / Cookies et al are user data for many apps.\r\n\r\nI agree with this completely. Even if the implementation is wrong it is not running in a broken state. So fixing the implementation will inadvertently break things. So unless you find a backwards compatible fix it should not be patched outright. (IE: Move the old cache and relink to it)\r\n\r\nFor a real life instance it would cause a headache as it would make our POS in all our store locations back to a default state that need to be reconfigured since we rely on Local Storage. And I imagine the same can be for many others."
