    "body": "Hmm I have overridden those methods in Chromium and I'm sure they are on the right place since other methods like `copy:` and `paste:` are also there, but the beep is still there.\n\nI also tested whether `ctrl-cmd-alt-down` would cause beep in Atom, and it does. The `ctrl-cmd-alt-down` maps to `makeTextWritingDirectionNatural:` and it is implemented in Chromium, so the problem is not we didn't implement the `makeBaseWritingDirectionNatural:` method, but something else.\n\nI looked into the key handling code of Chromium and tried to comment out different parts of code, however the beep is always there, I'm out of ideas now.\n"
