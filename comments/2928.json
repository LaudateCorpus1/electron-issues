Maybe this will work for you?\n"

How can you detect when these events walk up the message loop?\n"

    "body": "Electron has its own message loop, so we get notified of Node's events by listening to Node's message loop's backend fd. However when some modules like `serialport` or `pty.js` add a few special events to Node's message loop, we will keep getting notified in Electron even when there is nothing happened. This problem is OS X only and I think it is a bug of OS X's `kqueue` implementation.\n\nIf you are interested in this you can look at the `atom/common/node_bindings_*` to have an idea of the implementation of Node integration.\n"
