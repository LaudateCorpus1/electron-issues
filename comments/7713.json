    "body": "Thank you kevinsawicki,\n\nI am not able to propose a coded solution as it is still a little bit out of my reach. I will be leaving here my use case for other to see.\n\nI am simply working on a long running app which need a large local cache so it still work if internet connectivity is lost. I will be using nginx on the client side for now.\n\nThis flag could solve this use case pretty well without resorting to write a cache through web worker and the node file system fs or using solution like squid, nginx or varnish.\n"
