    "body": "With latest libchromiumcontent and brightray we can provide 64bit support, however currently we got stuck with old libchromiumcontent because latest V8 APIs are not compatible with node v0.10.x, and we were waiting for node v0.12.x which should be compatible with the V8 of newer Chromium.\n\nHowever due to what happened recently, I think node v0.12.x would not come out in near future. I'll update atom-shell to use latest libchromiumcontent and node v0.11.x, which would bring 64bit and Linux support, though it could take some time.\n"
