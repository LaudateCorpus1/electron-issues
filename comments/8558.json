    "body": "Thanks for the test case. But I think this is most likely a misuse of formidable or a bug in it, depends on if the encoding of the data is maintained when written to the file. Replace `fileData` with the following,\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst defaultEncodedFileData = fs.readFileSync(files.upload.path)\r\nconst fileData = Buffer.from(defaultEncodedFileData.toString(), 'binary')\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso tested with\r\n\r\n```\r\n// Replace upload data in http handler with:\r\nresRequest.uploadData = {\r\n  contentType: 'application/octet-stream',\r\n  data: binaryData.toString('binary')\r\n};\r\n\r\n// replace /upload path handler with:\r\nif (req.url == '/upload' && req.method.toLowerCase() == 'post') {\r\n  let body = ''\r\n  req.on('data', (data) => {\r\n    if (data) {\r\n      body += data\r\n    }\r\n  })\r\n  req.on('end', () => {\r\n    const equal = binaryData.equals(Buffer.from(body, 'binary'))\r\n    res.writeHead(200, {'content-type': 'text/plain'});\r\n    res.end(`Binary data is ${equal ? 'ok' : 'corrupted'}`);\r\n  })\r\n  return;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nClosing since its not a bug in Electron. Also upload with custom protocol isn't much flexible for file uploads now, there is an issue tracking to enhance it https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/8503"
