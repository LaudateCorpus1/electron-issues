The `will-create-webview` event can be used to strip out the `preload` option, and `webview-created` event can be used to add a listener to the `will-navigate` event of webview's WebContents to decide whether to navigate to a page.\n\nI'm merging this to #2749.\n\n> @zcbenz If nodeintegration is not enabled on the browser window, and am using a preload script, what is the security issue?\n\nIt should be as safe as running an un-sandboxed page in Chrome browser.\n"
