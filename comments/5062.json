    "body": "First of all, say hi to @bennyn for me! To respond to your question: Giving people better options for customizing the toolbar on Windows is still something that I'd like to see (if I ever get to it). For the Window icon, things _should_ look okay if you have 16x16 and 32x32 (check out [VSCode, for instance](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/resources/win32/)). However, I currently don't have Windows 7 around and I'm not sure if there's anything wrong with Windows 7.\n\nFor the tray icon, yep, that too is still hard to get right. Let's have this issue serve for fixes to both.\n"
