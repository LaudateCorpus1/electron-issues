    "body": "Sorry about the lack of follow up - so it happens when I try to open a second Atom window - the first one always opens fine, but the second one will sometimes (often) open to just the default background before giving the timeout.\n\nMy own code: http://osvr.github.io though the specific code I'm thinking of isn't open source - doing directx rendering for virtual reality headsets using some vendor-specific calls.\n\nWhen I switched my system to the hetgpu setup, it revealed that the code was assuming that the NVIDIA adapter was the default adapter, and thus calling `D3D11CreateDevice` with a null first parameter, and `D3D_DRIVER_TYPE_HARDWARE` second parameter, to let Windows choose the default adapter when creating the device.\n\nInstead, we needed to do some magic calls to NVIDIA, and/or DirectX, so that we'd end up getting a specific `IDXGIAdapter`. For safety, then, we always (though really only needed in multi-gpu setups) pass that in the first parameter and thus `D3D_DRIVER_TYPE_UNKNOWN` in the second parameter (because that's what Microsoft says you have to do if you pass in a non-null adapter pointer)\n"
