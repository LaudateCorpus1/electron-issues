    "body": "I am confused, how is it that apparently all framework related devtools extensions fail under Electron but not under NW.JS, which as far as I know should have the same CEF/Devtools extensions API implementation. Patching React Devtools seems not to be a viable option, for the reasons others have stated previously, but also because the same patch would seem necessary for all the other problematic/failing Devtools extensions.\n\nLet us indulge this route anyway: What \"Other Things\" should the patched React Devtools extension do differently in the context that it detects the operating environment is Electron/CEF and not a browser? Did I overlook some nuggets of wisdom in these devtools issue threads... @zcbenz  \"The extensions are handled under atom/browser/lib/chrome-extension.coffee, we need to read the content_scripts and apply them in the renderer.\" - this statement was the closest thing I could find to a supposed fix, however I can't wrap my head around what is suggested. Support for content_scripts API must be emulated and manually \"applied in the renderer\"?\n\nWhat is NW.JS doing or not doing which is enables it to work? It would seem the fact NW.JS merges Node into a unified context vs. Electron using a separate process should not effect CEF's apps/extensions APIs end of things. If it works in NW.JS my guess would be that Electron lacks one of more API's which NW.JS doesn't. Not surprising as NW.JS is in excellent cadence with CEF/Blink updates. Now if we only knew exactly what the missing API(s) are, then maybe we would be a step closer to a final solution.\n"
