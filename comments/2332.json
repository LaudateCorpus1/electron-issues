    "body": "Hey @72lions — we use Electron and haven't run into any inconsistencies between it and Chromium re: scrolling performance, even in lists with tons of items. I'd definitely try using the Chromium Developer Tools profiler and see if your nodejs app is doing anything else. Since the renderer process runs your NodeJS code and renders, things like scrolling and CSS animations can be severely impacted by javascript you're running.\n\nIt might also be worth adding `transform: translate3d(0,0,0);` to the CSS style of your scroll container (the div with overflow:auto/scroll). This forces that div to be GPU-composited and generally makes scrolling more smooth :-)\n"

Trying to think of other things that were introduced between 0.25.1 and 0.30.4.\n\n@bkniffler do you have a small Electron app that could be used as a test case?

At least with my eyes running in both platforms looks exactly the same on my Windows 8.1 machine. The scrolling of the background is very smooth. \n"

I've been doing some testing with Quartz Debug, and that change makes Mac OS X think the entire contents of the Electron window need to be composited as a \"non-opaque region\". @bkniffler your sample app runs smoothly for me as well, but it might be that I have a more powerful GPU so the compositing workload isn't noticeable. (On a Macbook Pro - Late 2013) On my machine, Quartz Debug shows ~48fps before that change and ~40fps afterward.\n\nThis change happened between 0.30.0 and 0.30.1. Try out 0.30.0 and see if it works better for you.\n\nIt seems that this same code was added to Chromium briefly and then rolled back out because it also caused performance regressions there. Going to see if there's a better way to achieve the rounded corners. https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=396264\n"
