    "body": "> Can we address this somehow?\r\n\r\nThis is application specific, access keys are supported to the `dialog.showMessageBox` API so apps could do this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\ndialog.showMessageBox({title: 'hello', buttons: ['&Yes', '&No']})\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat would make `Yes` selectable with `Alt-Y` and `No` selectable with `Alt-N`.\r\n\r\n>  Can we create a \"close all and dismiss\" function?\r\n\r\nApplications should manage this type of behavior, Electron only provides raw dialog APIs that should be used with good user experience in mind.\r\n\r\n> Is this the intended repository for this issue, might be wrong here but looks like it's more intended for atom/atom or Microsoft/vscode\r\n\r\n👍 Closing out here."
