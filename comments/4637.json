I'm planning on adding support for `document-scoped` bookmarks but it seems a little tricky.\r\n\r\n**Please note** however, that this module uses `nodobjc` to bridge to the `Objective-C` runtime, and I'm not sure it if will pass the Apple Store Review process, I haven't yet tried.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nMy implementation of the `bookmarks` API is rudimentary, and rather hacky considering it's all done through bridging. Apple provides APIs in the `CoreFoundation` frameworks which are easily accessible in `C` or `C++` (what `chromium` and `electron` are mainly written in) which would be *extremely preferred* to accessing the `Objective-C` runtime through node bridging."
