Travis will kill the process or output a warning when a process eats up too much memory. However there is absolutely nothing logged on Travis' end. What I can do is do more research and log out the utilized / available memory of the process as it runs until it crashes.\n\nAll this is doing is navigating to a single website, and clicking one link to navigate to another. That is it. I even have node-integration disabled. The app is you run-of-the-mill angular app with nothing crazy on it. Just a bunch of pictures, no video, canvas or anything else.\n\nI could see memory being an issue if this was a long running web app that had severe memory leaks, but this is crashing within 5-10 seconds on the 2nd page.\n"

I was about ready to give up and then boom, it worked on `0.31.2`. \n\nHere is the table of results:\n\n| Version | Results |\n| --- | --- |\n| 0.36.0 | crash |\n| 0.35.4 | crash |\n| 0.34.5 | crash |\n| 0.34.0 | crash |\n| 0.33.9 | crash |\n| 0.33.6 | crash |\n| 0.33.3 | crash |\n| 0.32.0 | crash |\n| 0.31.2 | PASS SOMETIMES |\n| 0.31.1 | PASS SOMETIMES |\n| 0.31.0 | PASS SOMETIMES |\n| 0.30.8 | PASS SOMETIMES |\n\nAt first every version below `0.32.0` passed but then I noticed each version would sometimes fail. After running the tests dozens of times on `0.30.8 - 0.31.2` I finally found the \"trigger\" that would make them all crash.\n\nIn my example app, I have a situation where I am typing into an `<input type=\"email\" />` field programatically. As it types each character, Chromium is supposed to check the value of the field and log out to the console that the value is not a valid email address. **If Chromium correctly checked this value and logged it out to the console the test would pass.**\n\nHere's an example from the Travis Logs:\n\n``` bash\n\"The specified value 'f' is not a valid email address.\"\n\"The specified value 'fo' is not a valid email address.\"\n\"The specified value 'foo' is not a valid email address.\"\n\"The specified value 'foo@' is not a valid email address.\"\n\"The specified value 'foo@test.' is not a valid email address.\"\n```\n\n **On builds where Chromium did not log out this value to the console, the test would crash.** My hypothesis is that Electron is crashing due to this scenario. \n\nWhen the value of a `input type=\"email\"` is programmatically applied, and then subsequently read I believe that is when it is crashing if Chromium does not do its validity check.\n"
