    "body": "@paulcbetts You are right... but targeting a dedicated display would be much more easy if done by the BrowserWindow itself instead of writing such ugly glue code to manipulate the coordinates. I'd still vote for adding an additional BrowserWindow option - especially because calculating coordinates myself makes options such as for showing the window centered obsolete.\n\n@frankhale I am undecided. On the one hand you are right, this might be a separate issue. On the other hand, if the BrowserWindow would know the display it belongs to, a dialog that got handed over the BrowserWindow as optional parameter could simply be shown on that same display. But good point, these things are definitely linked to each other and strenghens my feeling that a BrowserWindow should explicitely know about the display it belongs to.\n"
