My situation is figuring out how to properly configure a cross platform dev setup (on OS X for Windows) for a project that (1) uses a native module and (2) is built on an electron boilerplate (bozon) that (3) uses webpack. And it's my first electron app. I've got it working great on OS X, but trying to get it to work on Windows has been very frustrating. "
