    "body": "After thinking about this a bit and looking at the Mac OS X docs, I think we should add a new option to `BrowserWindow`:\n- `titleBarHeight: <pixels from top of window>`\n\nThis would be the vertical offset at which sheets should be positioned. I'd also like to change the behavior of `titleBarStyle` (an existing option) on Mac OS X. The current behavior is:\n- `titleBarStyle`: `hidden` results in a hidden title bar and a full size content window, yet the title bar still has the standard window controls (\"traffic lights\") in the top left.\n- `titleBarStyle`: `hidden-inset` results in a hidden title bar with an alternative look where the traffic light buttons are slightly more inset from the window edge.\n\nThe problem is that \"slightly more inset\" is not quite right for our app which uses a Safari-sized toolbar that is 38px tall. (They're too far down) I think we should deprecate the `hidden-inset` option and instead make `hidden` automatically position the window controls so they are centered within the `titleBarHeight` if it's provided. So for example, `titleBarStyle:hidden, titleBarHeight: 80` would center the buttons 40px from the top of the window and display sheets 80px from the top of the window.\n\n@zcbenz does that sound good? I can submit a patch for this if that approach makes sense.\n"

I don't think your approach would work for that use case (Preference windows like this are a reasonably common screen on OS X).\n\nI think it's best to decouple the offset of the sheets from the offset of the buttons if it's possible? If you want to couple them then it's trivial to do it in Javascript. Perhaps I'm missing some of the reasoning behind the coupling though.\n"

    "body": "`titleBarHeight` sounds nice and declarative but it also seems a bit implicit if the only effect of the property is to offset sheet dialogs. If this is the case I would probably be in favour of something more explicit like `sheetVerticalOffset` but not strongly so. I understand `sheetVerticalOffset` sounds ugly and non-declarative but it more directly describe the effect of setting the property.\n\nI take your point about the BrowserWindow config becoming a bit of a mess. Another possibility is to move the option to `dialog.showX()` instead? I'm not sure how I feel about that but it does add more flexibility [1] when you define the sheet offset directly at the call site. I don't really have an opinion on this but it's worth considering at least.\n\n[1] e.g. if the titlebar height changes on the UI or you want to do something crazy like a sheet within a sheet.\n"
