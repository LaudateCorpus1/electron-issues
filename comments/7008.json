Unfortunately it seems that there is a bug in `node-sass` that prevents people from rebuilding it for Electron, [a fix has been merged in](https://github.com/sass/node-sass/pull/1634) but a new release hasn't come out yet. So, you'll have to install `node-sass` directly from the GitHub repo to get the fix in the meantime, and then rebuild it.\n"

Fortunately you should be able to bypass that runtime check by setting the path to the rebuilt `node-sass` binary. If you look at [how `node-sass` searches for the binary](https://github.com/sass/node-sass/blob/v3.9.3/lib/extensions.js#L243) you'll see you can either set the `SASS_BINARY_PATH` env var or the `npm_config_sass_binary_path` NPM config var to point to the rebuilt `.node` binary.\n"
