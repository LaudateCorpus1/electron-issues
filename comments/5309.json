    "body": "This is something you should probably (and can quite easily) handle yourself.\n\nSimply hook into the [`will-download`](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/api/session.md#event-will-download) event on a session object.  Then listen for the [`done` event](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/api/download-item.md#event-done) on the DownloadItem.  When that done event is fired you can manually call the [bounce method](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/api/app.md#appdockbouncetype-os-x)\n\nUntested example code:  \n\n``` js\nwin.webContents.session.on('will-download', function(event, item) {\n  item.on('done', function(e, state) {\n    if (state === 'completed') {\n      app.dock.bounce();\n    }\n  });\n});\n```\n"
