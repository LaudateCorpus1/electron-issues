    "body": "Sorry for pitching in late on this, actually @zcbenz this can be fixed without patching chromium by setting  `override_state` to `blink::WebPageVisibilityStateVisible` [here](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/codesearch#chromium/src/content/public/renderer/content_renderer_client.h&rcl=1433115003&l=245) .  We could provide this as an optional feature for users as a option during browser window creation and override the state to always visible whenever the flag is present, can send a PR if sounds good. \n"
