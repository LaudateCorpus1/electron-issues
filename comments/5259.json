    "body": "Good question, @miniak. I've always seen `'use strict'` as a cumbersome way to access newer JavaScript features, but you're absolutely right that it could be providing some protection against erroneous code.\n\nI think most of the protections we get from `use strict` are covered by `standard`'s eslint config.\n\nThere is a fork of `standard` called [`strict-standard`](https://github.com/denis-sokolov/strict-standard) that I found via https://github.com/feross/standard/issues/382. I tried to run it on this branch but [I couldn't get it to work](https://github.com/feross/standard/issues/382).\n"
