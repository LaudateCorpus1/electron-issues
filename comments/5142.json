    "body": "It is possible to change to another mirror depending on the build system of vscode, for example the `electron-download` module provides a env variable to specify the mirror: https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-download. However the only mirror server I know is located in China, so it might not help you.\n\nOr you can contact GitHub to complain about the slow connection: https://github.com/contact.\n"
