    "body": "Hi @marcatec, thanks for your feedback.\r\n\r\nWe definitely use feature requests to prioritize upcoming work. If you can share more about your application, and what it's trying to accomplish that helps justify the work. No promises, but every bit of information helps.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, we do accept community pull requests. For significant changes, we first like to discuss the proposed idea in the open, and allow community feedback. I would recommend using the [Rust RFC Template](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/0000-template.md) as a good place to start."

    "body": "Hello @groundwater, I further investigated my case, and am not sure any more if it's a real feature request.\r\n\r\nWhat we want is similar to a feature in the app Svgsus, made with Electron.\r\nThey transform svg files via drag and drop, without dropping.\r\nIt can be seen in their video at time 0:17. http://www.svgs.us/images/svgsus_developer_video_web.mp4\r\n\r\nMy conclusion is, that is only possible loading the html page via file protocol.\r\nIn our app we use http (with a local server) and that case is restricted to provide the file info only on drop, not on dragenter or dragover.\r\n\r\nIs that behaviour hard coded into Chromium or is there a switch or can one be implemented?\r\nMay there be a chance to solve it using a custom protocol?\r\n"
