This is a programming error. Break on void _NSWarnForDrawingImageWithNoCurrentContext() to debug.  This will be logged only once.  This may break in the future.\n2016-03-14 20:07:33.651 Google Chrome[8962:273404] Inconsistent set of values to create NSBitmapImageRep\n```\n\nSo it is a bug of Google Chrome, I'm closing this since it is just a warning. If you are really worried about this, I would suggest reporting it to Chromium's issues list.\n"
