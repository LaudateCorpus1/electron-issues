    "body": ":+1: I agree.\nThis is related to a discussion we had a while back [here](https://github.com/atom/electron/issues/2452#issuecomment-131931426).\n\nI think it should be in a separate \"Supported Platforms\" doc. That way people could add to it more specific notes for each platform. For example, instead of just saying that Ubuntu 14.04+ is supported/tested, it could list all the other distributions that users confirmed work with the binary releases, and information about distributions that will work only if you compile it yourself.\n\nRegarding the versions Paul mentioned:\n- Ubuntu 14.04 is the current LTS. Is that really the minimal version that we support? I would expect it be 12.04 or maybe even 10.04.\n- The only mention I see in the issues about OS X versions is that we only support 64 bit versions. So that would suggest 10.7 Lion, which was the first version only available on 64 bit Intel CPUs.\n- What about Windows Server 2008 R2+?\n\n/cc @jlord \n"
