But I don't get what an \"electron zip\" is, especially as electron is installed via npm, not from a zip file.\r\n\r\nMaybe @RobsonMi meant the release built from the project. This includes an .exe file and a folder with project files. I don't see how the \"electron zip\" could relate to these though.\r\n\r\nI can download a zip file from https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-prebuilt. But that contains no \"pdf.dll\".\r\n\r\nBy the way: I am using https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate which in turn uses https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder to build a release.
