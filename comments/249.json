I also like macgap (<10MB) but unfortunately some of their apis are broken atm and they don't really have a solution for saving files and accessing os functionality.

Finally, some minor modifications to the IPC socket systems to prevent it from using /tmp, /var/private.\n\nIt's not as bad as it sounds, there's a patch at: https://github.com/trevorlinton/chromium/blob/node/MacAppStoreSupport.diff.  \n\nDownside is it removes support for MacOS X snow leopard.\n"
