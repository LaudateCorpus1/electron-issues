In theory, it takes about 11 weeks for changes in Canary builds to reach Stable, so we could expect to see this in Stable in late October.\n\nIt's possible we could backport the change to the version of Chromium we're using now, but I don't know how much the relevant source files have changed.\n"

In most cases that's enough but for the more gnarly errors a full stack trace is required. So it will be nice when we have it but not necessary.\n"
