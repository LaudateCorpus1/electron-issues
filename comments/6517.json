I personally think it's a glitch at a Windows OS level but someone might be able to prove that wrong.\n\nAnd the fact that the start menu did the same thing indicates this is not Electron's fault.\n\nI tried this on a Windows 7 machine and couldn't reproduce at all.  Can you provide the steps you took in the demo app to make this happen.\n"
