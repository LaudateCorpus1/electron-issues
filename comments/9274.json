Once the drag is complete I would like to remove the temporary file, but I don't know when the system is done transferring the file. I could use a `setTimeout`, yet then I would be assuming the file size.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nipcMain.on('ondragstart', (e, path) => {\r\n  e.sender.startDrag({\r\n    file: path,\r\n    icon: join(__static, '/drag.png')\r\n  })\r\n\r\n  /* How do I know when the system is done copying the file? */\r\n\r\n  removeSync(path)\r\n})\r\n```"
