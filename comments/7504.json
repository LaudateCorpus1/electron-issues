    "body": "The webview is very tightly connected to its parent window, this is a design made in Chromium and we can not change that, I suggest reporting this to [Chromium's issues list](https://crbug.com) instead.\n\nAs for the tabs in Chrome, they are actually `BrowserWindow`s instead of `<webview>`s. \n"
