    "body": "Actually calling `SetAllowOverlappingViews(false)` for devtools's web contents (which is in fact reverting brightray/brightray#31) fixed the strange issues when accelerated composition is on. In atom-shell the main window is not inheriting form `UnderlayOpenGLHostingWindow`, this seems to be the reason why atom-shell doesn't have the flashing devtools issue.\n\nBut the frameless window still doesn't work anyway if the accelerated composition is on, I think we could just disable accelerated composition for frameless windows for now.\n"
