    "body": "I've never had problems using speechSynthesis with Chrome itself, but in\nChromium/Node-js, the voices do not load.\n\nI'm sorry, I don't have the references any more, but a few months ago, I\nspent a couple of days tracking down the problem and finally found that the\nrelevant functions have been deactivated for some reason, and that there\nare no plans to reintroduce them. If you're interested, I'd suggest\nsearching Chromium's Bugzilla - I'm pretty sure that's where I finally\nfound that info.\n\nI ended up using the http://responsivevoice.org/ service. It's free for\nnon-commercial use and pretty good. There can be a slight delay depending\non your Internet speed.\n\nThe only other alternatives I can think of:\n1. if your coding is way better than mine, build your own version of\n   electron with the speechSynthesis functionality restored.\n2. There are a few plugin voices that work with Chromium, but they are\n   all rather poor quality.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nCheers,\nIan\n\nOn 6 September 2016 at 06:44, Kurisu Brooks notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> Take a look here for a workaround:\n> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21513706/getting-the-list-of-voices-in-\n> speechsynthesis-of-chrome-web-speech-api\n> \n> —\n> You are receiving this because you commented.\n> Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\n> https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/586#issuecomment-244822064,\n> or mute the thread\n> https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AFj50UkEoi44YTZbfD6vewjIGHTwXtMXks5qnKlHgaJpZM4CYP0V\n> .\n"
