If you want a workflow like this I would suggest using some kind of middleman that downloads the JS script to a temporary location and then launches it.\r\n\r\nJust as a \"for instance\" what would `app.getAppPath()` return if launched from an URL like this.\r\n\r\nTLDR: It isn't documented and isn't currently supported"
