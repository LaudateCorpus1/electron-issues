There is also MDN as a good reference. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/page-break-inside\r\n\r\nBut if Chrome responds the same was as Electron then we can't do much about it.  Especially in this case where they are probably just strictly implementing the spec (so it's not technically a bug)"
