    "body": "It's showed because the [renderer sandbox is disabled](https://github.com/atom/atom-shell/commit/34c4d734af9f28ec51c4e3b259863519713e408b), otherwise many node functions won't work. It is in fact not a error message, but a kind warning. Removing it only needs a one line patch for chromium.\n\nBut I want to keep this message so I can know whether and when the renderer has started, it's helpful for debugging. How about replacing it with a warmer message? like:\n\n```\n[0611/105852:INFO:renderer_main.cc(212)] Renderer started without sandbox\n```\n"
