I'll get back to you soon (but pls consider that my original objective is to run vs code anyway)\nBTW I'm using this [mirror](http://mirrors.cicku.me/archlinux/community/os/x86_64/electron-1.4.4-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.xz), is it fine? ... ehm, maybe better the link \"electron-v1.4.4-linux-ia32.zip\" from https://github.com/electron/electron/releases/tag/v1.4.4. Will let you know asap\n"

I have seen people with other software based on the chromium embedded framework (libcef) say that libcef requires SSE2, and therefore try to say that it isn't their responsibility to fix the bug, because it is in libcef, not in the software they write which uses libcef.\n\nand\n\n> I'm almost convinced these illegal instruction errors are because one of the 3rd party libraries that Spotify uses requires SSE2 enabled processor\n"
