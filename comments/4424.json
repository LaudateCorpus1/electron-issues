    "body": "I'm also super into this, but I'd say that the implementation on both OS X and Windows is not trivial. For starters, the Windows 10 UWP Notification API is super rich and can do all kinds of fancy things, but it doesn't use callbacks, but instead activation arguments (which is cool, because one can launch other apps via notification, but the model makes it hard to implement in Electron). Good news: [Code is available](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/tiles_and_toasts/archive/2015/10/16/quickstart-handling-toast-activations-from-win32-apps-in-windows-10.aspx).\n\nOn OS X, things are a little bit less difficult, but still annoying (the model is super-limiting, as @bengotow already pointed out). However, if we conform to the limits, a callback is fairly simple: We already ask the `userNotificationCenter` for the activation; and the notification object has a `activationType` property. The whole thing is a bit silly, but simple enough - it's basically 'that one action clicked' or 'that other action clicked' ;-)\n\nBasically, if somebody wants to have a coffee/beer session with me (Nylas? Slack? GitHub?), we could probably hack this out in three hours or so.\n"

    "body": "Hey! I've started playing with this, and it looks like it may be more of a mess than I imagined. I was able to add a libchromiumcontent patch to [remove an assertion](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/third_party/WebKit/Source/modules/notifications/Notification.cpp#82) which blocked calls to `new Notification...` with an actions array, and extend brightray to display Mac OS X notifications with the action titles:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1037212/14071769/887055ea-f46d-11e5-99f1-d1e42c0cedac.png)\n\nIt looks like we may be blocked on the event-handling side, though. Chromium calls `PlatformNotificationService.DisplayNotification` with an instance of [content::DesktopNotificationDelegate](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/2ee1f3c08f9d1e46bdeb42dc8435dd30d81f0ae6/content/public/browser/desktop_notification_delegate.h), not the (way more robust) [message_center::NotificationDelegate](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git/+/lkcr/ui/message_center/notification_delegate.h). It looks like the notifications API is unified on the JavaScript side but platform notifications and the \"message center\" are disconnected concepts?\n\nAny ideas? I'm just beginning to source-dive Chromium so I may be wrongâ€”I haven't traced far enough back to see where they become separated. Haha @felixrieseberg I think some beers might definitely be in order...\n\nOne other caveat I discovered:\n\nOn Mac OS X, notifications with actions are \"Alerts\", which are sticky. To show \"Alert\"-style notifications, the app needs to be code-signed and include an item in it's Info.plist. Beyond being a bit of a pain, this means that effectively re-producing native behaviors might require additional APIs for programmatically dismissing notifications, which I don't think exist.\n"
