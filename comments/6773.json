    "body": "I don't know if the changes would be useful outside of Electron, AFAIK Chrome/Chromium only uses the app indicator in a \"Unity compatible\" way. But I agree, the changes are pretty big, so trying to push them straight into the Chromium project might make more sense than making a huge patch file.\n\nThe problem I have with this is that this greatly increases the scope and impact of the changes, and I have no experience with the whole testing / [try server stuff](https://www.chromium.org/developers/testing/try-server-usage) (and I don't even know if I can use it). Currently, I just build using libchromiumcontent's build system and test manually, and even that is pushing the limits of my workstation (especially since I do it in a VM). I'm reading up on the Chromium project docs, but any pointers on how this can be done more smoothly are welcome.\n\nPS. I don't really think this issue is a bug, IMO the `enhancement` label fits better. Also, since it only impacts distributions using app indicator (i.e Ubuntu Unity), `linux-distribution-specific` looks like a more specific label than `linux` (IMO it should even be called `distribution-specific`. There's nothing stopping you from running Gnome or Unity on top of e.g BSD). I'm planning to make a different issue for the GTK status icon.\n"

    "body": "I have PoC for my workaround implemented in Chromium, but after some discussion with @eglaysher I decided against trying to include the code in the Chromium project. Since the workaround relies on undocumented internal signals of the Unity panel, the workaround could stop working when Ubuntu makes changes to their Panel code. My workaround will also break menu scrubbing in the app indicator area, to quote @eglaysher:\r\n\r\n> IIRC, EntryActivated isn't what you want for this; it's explicitly not a click event. So, let's say you're a user and you have three appindicators in your bar, something system provided like the network menu, the system provided bluetooth menu and your electron app provided appindicator. The user mouse downs (and then mouse ups) on the network icon which displasy a menu. The user mouse moves from the network icon to under the bluetooth icon, which hides the first network menu and displays the bluetooth menu. The user continues to move their mouse to the electron app's icon (and not touch any buttons!), dismissing the first menu, but then breaking the menu scrubbing as your app treats the mouse over as a click, and you make your own x11 window which takes focus.\r\n>\r\n> I'm trying to steer you away from treating the appindicator area as a set of buttons because the appindicator model, both to the programmer and the user, is that of a menu, and you're going to break user expectations in not-so-subtle ways if you treat it as a set of buttons. The unity appindicator area is implemented with GtkMenu (and iirc, the kde one is implemented with QMenu), and uses dbusmenu to copy the GtkMenu/QMenu structure from the user program to the menu displayed by the appindicator widget, and then ferries menu events from the appindicator widget back to the GtkMenu/QMenu instance in your program.\r\n> \r\n> The way you're proposing to do things will break menu scrubbing, including accidental scrubbing, which happens all the time. This is why I'm trying to push you to use something like chrome's current replacement menu item workaround.\"\r\n\r\nThe root cause of this issue is Ubuntu Unity treating the \"status icon area\" as a menu instead of as \"a set of buttons displayed as icons\", making Unity in essence incompatible with \"menubar\" style apps. Unless Canonical changes this, a proper fix for this issue is impossible.\r\n\r\nI am now looking in to moving the workaround to Electron. In theory it is possible to move everything into the Electron source tree, but having the workaround as part of Chromium makes sense because:\r\n- The workaround needs to know the name of the libappindicator library and [Chromium already has code that figures this out](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/chrome/browser/ui/libgtkui/app_indicator_icon.cc#104).\r\n- There is already [code that deals with low-level Unity functions in Chromium](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/chrome/browser/ui/libgtkui/unity_service.cc), so my workaround fits way nicer in Chromium than in Electron.\r\n\r\nOther options are moving the workaround to [Brightray](https://github.com/electron/brightray), but I'm not sure if this fits in the scope of Brightray, or adding it as a [patch to libchromiumcontent](https://github.com/electron/libchromiumcontent/tree/master/patches), but it's quite a lot of code to put in a patch...\r\n\r\nWhat do you think is best option @zcbenz?"
