    "body": "Extensions shouldn't include the `'.'` or the `'*.'` (e.g. `'png'` is valid extension name, but `'*.png'` or `'.png'` is not). So in your case you should use `'*'`, which does work (at least for me using v0.30.4 on Windows).\nFor example:\n\n``` javascript\nfunction openDialogExample() {\n    var remote = require('remote');\n    var dialog = remote.require('dialog');\n\n    return dialog.showOpenDialog(\n      remote.getCurrentWindow(),\n      {\n          defaultPath: 'c:/',\n          filters: [\n              { name: 'All Files', extensions: ['*'] },\n              { name: 'Images', extensions: ['jpg', 'png', 'gif'] },\n              { name: 'Movies', extensions: ['mkv', 'avi', 'mp4'] }\n            ],\n          properties: ['openFile']\n      }\n    );\n}\n```\n"

I misread your example.\n\nAt least now we know the issue reconstructs on Linux but not on Windows.\n\nIn your example you show 4 filters with exactly the same name and the first one seems like it could break everything since it doesn't include an extension array with at least one item. Also it seems your missing the opening quote for each filter name.\nCan you try running it with just this single filter:\n\n``` javascript\nfilters: [\n    { name: 'All Files', extensions: ['*'] }\n]\n```\n"

It seems that no matter what the extension is, we add `'.'` to it. So instead of `'*'` you get `'.*'` which explains why it treats `*` as an actual extension and not a wildcard.\nIf this really is the issue, the fix should be really simple (add the `'.'` only if the extension is not `'*'`). \nI don't have access to Linux right now, do you want to try and fix it? \n"
