    "body": "It maybe will not do a job for you, there is not solution yet to disable webrtc buildin in electron, but you can do it in this way if you inject js file on preload \n\n```\nnavigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia = undefined;\nnavigator.webkitGetUserMedia = undefined;\nnavigator.mozGetUserMedia = undefined;\nnavigator.getUserMedia = undefined;\nwebkitRTCPeerConnection = undefined;\nMediaStreamTrack = undefined;\nRTCPeerConnection = undefined;\n```\n\nbut still this is not a solution, because you cant inject this script in iframes.\n\nfor me it was a solution because i was using nightmarejs wich use electron this is why i asked this question here, but then i realized [webdriver.io](http://webdriver.io/) and i switched on this because it is using firefox and webrtc is disabled by default `i forget wich version` or you can do it.\n"
