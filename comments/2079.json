I guess you could have a third party service which does everything except code-signing, but then one would still need to automate the code-signing on Windows and Mac platforms.

What I meant was that the `electron-packager` itself does not ask anything about signing, it just seems to build the binary? Now I don't know if that's because electron binaries are already signed or they are missing this part out totally? Either way I think your concern is valid although I have seen other build services e.g. Phonegap handle signing keys securely so to make building in the cloud more hassle-free than building locally.\n"

    "body": "@jasdeepkhalsa I'm not sure about `electron-packager` but I think Mac will require everything in the .app to be signed, not just binary but also javascript source. Windows might be fine with a pre-signed Electron binary (and maybe even if you rename it), but then I think you won't be able to edit any of the exe details (e.g. version, publisher, copyright). Hope that helps.\n"
