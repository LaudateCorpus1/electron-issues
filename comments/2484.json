    "body": "I found the root cause of the issue, thanks to @hongrich help on Slack's #electron channel. In order to make `navigator.language` (and generally, language detection) working in Electron on Mac, the `Resources` directory should contain a `<lang>.lproj` empty directory for each supported language. Since the directory is empty and git doesn't track empty dirs, I actually lost it when importing our project (including Electron pre-built binaries) to git.\n"
