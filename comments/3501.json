    "body": "@benjaminRomano I've turned on the snap assist and indeed one of the atom windows froze until I moved it. Before turning on snap assist everything was fine, but now that I've turned it on and off again, any time I open a new atom window and snap it to one of the edges, it freezes (I got 2 on the different sides freezing at the same time now). After turning on my second monitor and extending the desktop, the issue was gone (now the Windows+Left/Right hotkeys are not working for some reason). Also, it seems that only the renderer process hangs, if I scroll one of the opened documents and then move the windows, the scrolling gets applied.\n"
