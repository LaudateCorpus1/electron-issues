    "body": "Do you mean that the `min-width` and `min-height` are doubled, but the `width` and `height` are not?\nIf all of them are doubled, the behavior you're describing sounds reasonable. An app designed on a 1920x1080 (FHD) screen, should have twice the width and height when running on a 3840x2160 (4K) screen of a similar size (the minimum and maximum of each dimension should be doubled as well).\n\nIn any case did you try using [`webFrame.setZoomFactor(factor)`](https://github.com/atom/electron/blob/master/docs/api/web-frame.md#webframesetzoomfactorfactor)? Some users used it to implement [HiDPI support](https://github.com/atom/electron/issues/615#issuecomment-116366096) on Linux, so I guess you might be able to use it in order to disable it.\n"
