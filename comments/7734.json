    "body": "Versions of the `electron` package on npm prior to 1.3.1 are actually a different package entirely, and will produce unexpected results. For older versions, you'll need to install `electron-prebuilt`.  See this blog post for more info about the `electron` and `electron-prebuilt` npm packages: http://electron.atom.io/blog/2016/08/16/npm-install-electron\n\nPerhaps the app is working/not-working for you because you have Electron installed globally on your system?\n\nTry this:\n\n``` sh\nnpm rm electron --save-dev\nnpm install electron-prebuilt@0.4.1 --save-dev\nnpm start\n```\n\nor to try it out with a newer version of electron:\n\n``` sh\nnpm rm electron --save-dev\nnpm install electron --save-dev\nnpm start\n```\n\nSee also https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/3755, which outlines a very similar issue.\n"
