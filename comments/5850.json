I hope a VM is not needed for the Electron updater.\n- There can be 3 major scenarios the updater\n1. A few files in my project has been changed so I would certainly like to change only those files instead of pushing the whole package\n2. Only Asar file(my project) is changed not the electron version\n3. Electron version of the new update is changed so I will need to update the Electron package as well.\n\nHow will it be managed?\n\nMany many thanks for the reply and paying attention to this discussion. \n"
