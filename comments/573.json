    "body": "There are 2 fixes for this error:\n1. Use newer electron version. Old one had this annoying bug so you can't use subscriptions for remote window in renderer. As I remember, I hadn't found method to bypass it(works only till renderer window reload, any attempts to unsubscribe on window unload hadn't work)\n2. Use those subscription inside start script instead of renderer. It's supposed to work this way, as I understand.\n\nAlso be careful with this thing. For ex., I got auth error with vk.com till I had use it(may be I did something wrong or them had additional checks for referal or something like that, but it costs me some facepalms).\n\nAlso, there are more powerful, but really tricky way - you can use http://www.telerik.com/fiddler/fiddlercore with electron to handle requests on C#/js side. To attach it you can use https://github.com/kexplo/electron-edge. I did it some time ago, useful trick.\nAlso seems it's Windows-specific decision.\nBenefit of it is that you can catch not only your app traffic, you can modify proxy for each request with custom logic, also you can modify response body, which isn't allowed using webRequest.*.\n"
