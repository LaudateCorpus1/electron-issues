All of them have RFCs and are properly specified.\n\nYour format is incomparable to even gzip deflate. It's literally just a concat, so you can't argue with tar being legacy here - because tar has the identical feature set AND is cross-platform, available everywhere. ASAR isn't and is not supported by any today's archive GUI tools and probably never will if the spec is missing.\n\nPersonally I think the \"what should replace ASAR\" discussion is off-topic. I would prefer a format that is cross-platform and can be understood by non-developers, allowing them to unpack and pack it with their GUI tools. A format that is specified and works everywhere natively in the OS. Not some custom format that has zero support for everything and introduces no features and is no invention.\n"

In the case of this issue Microsoft VS Code doesn't use an ASAR but the code in Electron still treats ASAR files like an archive. As a result their editor does too. Whereas they want them to be treated like any other editor would treat them.\n\nAnd the idea of ASAR wasn't to reinvent an archive format but to create a new one that met the purposes specific to Electron. And other archive formats didn't meet this. I think NW.js is evidence that using a widely used archive format (zip) just doesn't work out especially with bigger and more complex programs.\n"
