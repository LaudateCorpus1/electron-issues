    "body": "> I believe we'd like to fix this when the site is generated so the links still work when hosted as Markdown on github.com vs the HTML version on electron.atom.io\n\nYep, we keep the files here as-is and then process them for `electron.atom.io` in `atom/electron.atom.io`. [This file](https://github.com/atom/electron.atom.io/blob/gh-pages/lib/doc-links.js) is parsing for `.md` but looks like it's missing some. I'll close this out here as the fix needs to happen over there and has an issue opened where @kevinsawicki mentioned: https://github.com/atom/electron.atom.io/issues/150\n"
