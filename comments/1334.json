IMO, 2 separate features would be good, and I'd be happy to start at them if you guys think they're good ideas.\n1) It would be nice to be able to just pass a key[up/down/press] event and an accelerator to a function and see if it lines up. I'd probably start here. \n\n2) See next comment below\n~~Create a LocalShortcutHandler setup, akin to globalshortcuthandler. This needs to be either enableable or disableable (using its own version of `GlobalShortcutListener::SetShortcutHandlingSuspended` that respects observers), or it needs to automatically enable/disable based on some sort of window focus.

    "body": "FYI: I have a temporary workaround, where I set up a small helper with a map that stores shortcuts by keystroke (and in my case, by some other stuff dependent on my apps architecture). Whenever a window focuses, all of the shortcuts are registered. Whenever a window blurs, it checks if any window has focus, and if one does, it leaves them enabled. If no window has focus anymore, then the shortcuts are unregistered.  Clearly, that could be tweaked to work on a per window basis, etc, to fit someones needs. \n\nDoes anyone have any opinion on how they'd like to see that implemented in atom shell? I'm still leaning towards putting something in API, but I might put a compatible js/coffee solution in first, then move over to the native way next. \n\nMy thoughts are as follows: \nLocal shortcuts can be cross window, or per window (so they are only active if a specific window has focus, or any window has focus). \n\n``` js\n// This is global, if any window in the app is focused it works\nLocalShortcut.register(accelerator, callback);\n\n// This is only active if someWindow has focus\nLocalShortcut.register(accelerator, callback, someWindow);\n```\n\nDoes anybody have any thoughts on that? Something missing? More functionality than wanted? Is the idea a welcome one (I know _something_ to fill the whole is wanted, but does this seem like a good fit)?\nIs everyone cool with a js/coffee solution first and a native/mate solution second? \n"
