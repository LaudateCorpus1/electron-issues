    "body": "Hey @ryhanson,\n\nThanks for the post. Really awesome you were able to get that working. I actually had a weird behavior the other does running my app on Windows 7. After I packaged the app using electron-packager, I tried to run it on my Windows 7 machine. Everything worked well but I was still having that one process lingering around. Funny thing is when I closed the explorer window that the app was sitting in, the process disappeared. Basically the folder with that packaged app had a process identical to the ones used when you initiate the app. It was really weird but, I think that was the issue. Thanks again for the insight. \n-Alec \n"
