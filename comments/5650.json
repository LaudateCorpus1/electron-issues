My understanding is that if the problem is in the application code there will be an application error which could be handled which is not the case here. Electron crashes without the possibility to ever capture what happened the the log in the first post is the only information I could capture.\n\nI gave a person to test the app with OS X 10.11.3 but he wasn't able to replicate it. Maybe it is also related to the operating system.\n"
