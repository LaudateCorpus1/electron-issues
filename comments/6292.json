    "body": "I have an idea about what is happening.\n\nMy application has its own handler for the Quit application menu item, because in some cases quitting may require interaction with the user (e.g. to save changes). If there is no issue preventing the application from closing, then it will explicitly close all of the main browser windows (not the modal dialog) and call app.exit(0). My application calls window.close() but does not wait for the window to be closed.\n\nThe crash happens when Browser::Exit() calls NativeWindow::CloseContents(). I suspect the crash is caused by a race condition, if the actual closing of the window is asynchronous.\n\nThe standard system Quit handler will beep when there is a modal window open, but my Quit handler is allowed to run even when there is a modal window open.\n"
