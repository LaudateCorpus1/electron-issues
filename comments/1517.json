    "body": "Thanks for the reply @zcbenz. \n\nMany Mac windows have a full sized tool bars which are draggable and, until fully natively supported, could be created in HTML/CSS.\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1385324/7405960/3e1958ce-eec0-11e4-85d4-cedc2afd89e3.png)\n\nI can't argue with the complexity of implementing it but ability to specify draggable regions would also allow for more unique app designs. See attached image. Both top and bottom bars are draggable. Designs such as these could be created in HTML/CSS if Electron would respect the `-webkit-app-region: drag`. \n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1385324/7405930/b6d0b6f0-eebf-11e4-866d-0c1c88a80f18.png)\n"
