    "body": "@zeke I believe the issue is not when node integration is disabled, but when you try to *scrub* it with a preload script after the fact. Basically we should warn that the preload script is running in the same context as the untrusted code, and JavaScript code can typically modify all other code in the same context.\r\n\r\nIf your preload script has event listeners, those could fire *after* your untrusted content loads. Prototypes implicitly used by those event handlers could be modified."
