    "body": "> There is no way to bind some kind of click handler to a notification, all clicking ever does it close the notification\n\nI can confirm that (at least on windows) the below code works and the click event is firing.\n\n``` js\nconst test = new Notification('Hello World');\ntest.onclick = () => console.log('Clicked the thing');\n```\n\n> There is no way to add actions/buttons to a notification.\n\nCurrently there is no way to add actions to the Notification API provided by Electron.  The enhancement can be tracked in it's existing issue #4424 \n\nClosing this out as a duplicate of #4424 as that appears to be the main/unresolved concern\n"
