Please let us know is there by any chance this can be landed in stable builds sometime soon.\n\ncurrently we are tying to inject script and highlight the words , which is overkill to scan entire document plus if there is any iframe it wont pass through due to CSP.\n\nHaving this \"webview.find\", implemented would be useful for many applications.\n\nThanks.\n"
