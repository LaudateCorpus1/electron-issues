    "body": "are you running offscreen rendering in GPU-accelerated mode? because in that case, the dummy window we show, displays the offscreen-rendered website instead of the default text shown on macOS or in software output mode, that's why it doesn't respond to resize events.\n\nwhen you use offscreen-render you should hide this browser window, because its purpose is that it renders into bitmaps you can access through the `'paint'` event on `WebContents`. it is just a side effect that on Windows in GPU mode it shows the website too.\n"
