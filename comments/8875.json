    "body": "> I am aware of filters for selecting certain file type, but if there was a way in which we could restrict the file size it would be great.\r\n\r\nThis would require support from the native Windows file dialog APIs, I'm not seeing anything in https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dn457282(v=vs.85).aspx that handles that.\r\n\r\nSo I don't think this will be possible, you'll just have to handle this in your application and notify the user when they select something too large and re-prompt.\r\n\r\nHave you seen this behavior in other apps that open the Windows file dialog?"
