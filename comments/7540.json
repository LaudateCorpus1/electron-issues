    "body": "@deepak1556 I was trying to verify that the sample app from #2816 now worked and I hit an issue. It seems like `POST` requests made end up getting sent with no `Content-Type` header and so servers (like [express](http://expressjs.com)) will fail to parse the data.\n\nI tried with the following app:\n\n### main.js\n\n``` js\nvar express = require('express');\nvar http = require('http');\nvar app = express();\nvar bodyParser = require('body-parser')\n\nhttp.createServer(app).listen(8000);\n\napp.use(bodyParser.json());\napp.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({\n  extended: true\n}));\n\napp.get('/', (request, response) => {\n  response.sendFile(__dirname + '/index.html')\n})\n\napp.post('/bar', (request, response) => {\n  response.send(request.body.data1).end()\n})\n\nlet window\n\nconst {BrowserWindow} = require('electron')\n\nrequire('electron').app.once('ready', () => {\n  window = new BrowserWindow({\n    width: 800,\n    height: 600\n  })\n  window.loadURL('http://localhost:8000')\n})\n```\n\n### index.html\n\n``` html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n    <title></title>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <form method='post' id='bar' name='bar' target='_blank' action='bar'>\n      <textarea id='data1' name='data1'>Some text</textarea><br>\n      <input type='submit' value='Submit'/>\n    </form>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\nThis can be explicitly set by passing in `extraHeaders` to `loadURL` but that isn't exposed in `<form>` tag posts. Do you think this is feasible to support? Otherwise everything in this pull request looks good to me.\n"
