Thanks!\n\n**[ Edit ]** It seems to me that using an (unsigned) integer big enough to hold a pointer (even on a 64bit machine) would suffice, as the relevant type `AcceleratedWidget` is already defined as either a pointer (`OS_WIN`, `OS_IOS`, `OS_MACOSX`, `OS_ANDROID`) or an integer (`USE_X11`, `USE_OZONE`).\n\nI understand that this may not hold true for any and all native handles you might expose at a later stage (although I can't come up with an actual example), and see how making such handles uniformly be stored as `Buffer`s would help standardize them and make them future proof, but I would still like your opinion on this.\n"
