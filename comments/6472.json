    "body": "> When specifying multiSelections in the open dialog properties, it's not possible to select any files at all. All files are greyed out. I also tried specifying filters but that didn't work with multiSelections either.\n\nYou need to include the `openFiles` option to open files and/or the `openDirectories` option to open directories.\n\nThere is a example of using them at the top of http://electron.atom.io/docs/api/dialog/#dialog\n"
