    "body": "I don't understand what the \"problem\" is. `$` exists just like I said it would -- this is the same behavior in Chrome and Electron. Even Firefox makes `$` available and it has similar semantics. It's just a variable (assigned a function), available only in the context of the console. The link I included documents it. Here it is again: https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/commandline-api#selector\n\nYou can prove it's not jQuery by checking out other properties on it. For example, `$.fn` doesn't exist; nor does `$.fn.jquery` (which would typically give you the version of jQuery as a string).\n"
