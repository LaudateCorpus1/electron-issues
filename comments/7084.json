    "body": "From the [documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_fork_modulepath_args_options) of child_process.fork() \n\n> It is important to keep in mind that spawned Node.js child processes are independent of the parent with exception of the IPC communication channel that is established between the two. Each process has it's own memory, with their own V8 instances. Because of the additional resource allocations required, spawning a large number of child Node.js processes is not recommended.\n\nElectron is built on top of Chromium and I think Chromium takes care of ending all processes spawned/forked  from the main process. This can be seen in the Chrome browser , where if the main process is killed all the tabs and other related processes are also ended. \n\nI don't think the same is implemented for processes spawned/forked from the renderer process. For that, you can save the reference to the child process when you spawn it and later kill it yourself. \n\ne.g \n\n```\n\nchild_process = spawn(scriptPath,[arg1, arg2 ] ,{detached:true});\n\nprocess.kill(-child_process.pid);\n\n```\n"
