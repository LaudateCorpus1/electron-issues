    "body": "As far as I can tell this is a side affect of having `nodeIntergration` enabled and the site wanting to use jQuery.\n\nWith `nodeIntergration` enabled jQuery detects a commonJS environment and attempts to export itself with `module.exports`.  When you are accessing external sites you should probably disable `nodeIntergration`.\n\nIf you change your sample to be\n\n``` js\nwin = new BrowserWindow({width: 800, height: 600, webPreferences: { nodeIntegration: false }});\n```\n\nIt detects javascript correctly.\n"
