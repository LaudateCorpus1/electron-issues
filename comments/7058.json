    "body": "When this PR was first submitted I was all :+1: on this, but having spent some time recently fighting a table in a markdown document I have changed my opinion to :-1::-1::-1:. Basically, your standard markdown table syntax doesn't allow line breaks within a cell, so you end up with these crazy long lines with embedded `<br>` tags (to force line breaks), so readability plummets. Then you realize you can embed an HTML `<table>` in the document so you can have (a somewhat, but not really) more readable document, only to discover that GitHub will throw your inline styles into the gutter and render your table however it pleases. Finally, you end up using deprecated HTML 4 attributes to force proper alignment of cell content. Victory at last! But was it worth it? Not really.\n"

    "body": "> markdown table syntax doesn't allow line breaks within a cell, so you end up with these crazy long lines\n\nI tend to agree with this sentiment. We have to consider that developers are consuming this documentation in a variety of ways. Some of them include:\n- [https://github.com/electron/electron/docs](github.com/electron/electron/docs)\n- [http://electron.atom.io/docs](electron.atom.io/docs)\n- Right inside the `$EDITOR`\n\n#7120 shipped recently, and the next [release](https://github.com/electron/electron/releases) of Electron (1.4.1) will include an `electron-api.json` file that describes all the APIs. I think a better way to reach tabular utopia would be to use this new structured data to render dynamic templates on electron.atom.io (or elsewhere). This will allow us a lot more flexibility in how we render and style the docs.\n\nNot seeing a lot of strong reactions either way from people here, so I'm going to close this out in favor of that approach.\n"
