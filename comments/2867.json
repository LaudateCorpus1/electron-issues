I know Microsoft is HUGE and it is hard to find the right team, but it can help understand the mysterious behaviors.\n"

    "body": "Fixing this Properly actually might be not particularly trivial if you have to do it The Hard Way. Basically:\n1. Every time a renderer process gets focus (either pragmatically, or via normal means), it needs to signal the browser process with its window ID.\n2. When someone calls `focus`, they signal the browser to ask, \"Can you tell whoever currently has focus to AllowSetForegroundWindow me?\"\n3. Browser has to IPC that renderer, who calls AllowSetForegroundWindow and responds back\n4. Once that completes, the Browser process has to then signal the `focus` caller and say \"Yep you can SetForegroundWindow now\"\n\nHowever, Windows probably has some heuristics around this and there might be a _way_ less involved way to do it (do all processes in a Job share SetForegroundWindow'ability? Maybe!)  This is where `win32prg` comes in, because the people on that list probably built some of this stuff.\n"

Therefore I understand that to have it working:\n- Win 10: the call needs to be made from the renderer process\n- Win 7, Win 8: the call needs to be made from the main process\n\nAs far I am concerned (see #3124), the call is made from the renderer process. If my assumptions are correct, I should get this working using windows 10. I will try it and report the result here.\n\nLooking forward to have the feedback from the Windows team :-).\nThanks to everyone involved!\n"
