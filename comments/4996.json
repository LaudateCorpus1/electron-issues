    "body": "Some colors get distorted. \n\nWhen you set `#111` as a `backgroundColor` the background color of the window becomes `#151515`, if you set `#222` it becomes `#2D2D2D`, but if you set `#F00` the color remains the same.\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/184170/14242656/dc74bcca-fa59-11e5-81a7-8a682dd57761.png)\n\nIn the image above, you can see how the background color of the window on the top has a different color even though according to the code their colors should be the same.\n"
