    "body": "After some investigation, I believe this bahavior is expected in Windows. \r\n\r\nExplanation below:\r\n\r\nThe pixels that got missed out after resize is the value of `GetSystemrics(SM_CYSIZEFRAME)` From [MSDN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms724385(v=vs.85).aspx):\r\n> SM_CYSIZEFRAME: The thickness of the sizing border around the perimeter of a window that can be resized, in pixels. SM_CXSIZEFRAME is the width of the horizontal border, and SM_CYSIZEFRAME is the height of the vertical border.\r\n\r\nOn my windows 7 machine, this value is `4px` which is close to the `5px` reported in this bug.\r\n\r\nIf you notice Windows File Explorer, the resizable frame portion of the window gets hidden after the window is maximized. This is to prevent the window from being resized by drag-drop the border after it is maximized. On frameless window, this should work the same because frameless window also has a resizable border of around 4px.\r\n\r\nThe border will be shown completely if we disable `resize` of the window. Example below will show the full pixels.\r\n```\r\nvar win = new BrowserWindow({\r\n    width: 800, \r\n    height: 600,\r\n    frame: false,\r\n    resizable: false\r\n  });\r\n  win.maximize();\r\n```"
