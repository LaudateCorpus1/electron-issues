    "body": "Hey! I don't know if there's a good cross-platform way to do this. On Mac OS X, you'd want to use the \"Accessibility\" APIs. Once your app asks for permission to use Accessibility to control the computer, you can basically do anything you want to any window. I'm not sure there are events for `moved`, etc., but you could certainly poll. Not sure about Windows 10, though.\n"
