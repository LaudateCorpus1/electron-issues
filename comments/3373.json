    "body": "Chromium itself is a much more complicated environment than Node.js, from [what I can find](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/golang-nuts/Vy8r05reLyw/gO-wetcSAgAJ) go-lang runtime is using some hacky way to initialize the environment, which seems to conflict with Chromium's environment.\n\nSo I suggest using the module in scripts forked by `child_process.fork`, which is very similar to upstream Node's environment. The root cause is in go-lang's internals, so unless some core go-lang developer looks into this we are not able to solve it.\n"
