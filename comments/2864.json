    "body": "I am very interested in seeing progress in this feature development. I am building a desktop gadget application that makes heavy use of canvas and transparent elements. In the mean time, I am using NW.js for this project, and while it supports transparent window as well, the fact that the transparent area is still blocking mouse clicks reduces the usability of the gadgets (especially when they are \"always on top\"). Having a setting to ignore all clicks will definitely be the one feature that attracts me to move to Electron.\n"
