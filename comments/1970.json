So  chromium has `AddAdditionalSchemes` on contentclient to let embedders register . Thought of providing a command line flag with comma searated values of custom schemes `--register-schemes=\"library,test,atom\"` . The problem facing now is since there is a restart of the process, the second time commandline params gets lost, any thoughts on how to fix it ?\n\nYou might try appending the command line parameters in `AtomBrowserClient::AppendExtraCommandLineSwitches`.\n\nAlso we should use `--register-standard-schemes` instead of `--register-schemes` since the `\"standard\"` is the key of the problem.\n"
