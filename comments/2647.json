    "body": "The chromedriver shipped in Electron is exactly the same with the upstream one, so by default it will only work for Chrome browsers instead of custom browsers like Electron. In order to use chromedriver together with Electron you have to tell it where to find Electron and makes it think Electron is Chrome browser.\n\nPull request to make the document clearer is welcomed.\n"
