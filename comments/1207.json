    "body": "I realise I can do that - historically it's been better to track move/resize tho\n\nTo get the right result you must first check if a Window is hidden and if so, show it.  \n\nYou then check if it's maximised/minimized and if so restore it\n\nTHEN you can measure it before closing it - of course the user can see this happening and indeed, animating the Window leads to some OSes reporting weird values/taking time to reach the 'real size' before you can close it - it can look weird and disorienting to users...\n\nI'll try to make it work tho and report back if I find any gotchas\n"
