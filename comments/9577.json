For reference, see [this issue](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/2640).\r\n\r\nThe trick is to not hide your application's window, but rather to hide the _entire_ application itself via `Window.sendActionToFirstResponder`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    globalShortcut.register('CommandOrControl+Alt+X', () => {\r\n        if (mainWindow.isVisible()) {\r\n            Menu.sendActionToFirstResponder('hide:');\r\n        } else {\r\n            mainWindow.show();\r\n        }\r\n    });\r\n```"
