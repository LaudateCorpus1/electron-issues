    "body": "Ok, if someone is looking for a workaround, here's mine: we can't pass functions with ipc because a `JSON.stringify()` is applied to the `Menu` template we send, so you'll have to declare your menu template in the main process, and use `event.sender.send` on the `click` key. I'm using React btw.\n\nin your main process:\n\n``` javascript\nipcMain.on('artistListContextMenu', (event) => {\n\n    var template = [\n        {\n            label : 'Add to queue',\n            click :  function() {\n                event.sender.send('artistListContextMenuReply', 'addToQueue');\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            label : 'Play next',\n            click :  function() {\n                event.sender.send('artistListContextMenuReply', 'playNext');\n            }\n        }\n    ];\n\n    var context = Menu.buildFromTemplate(template);\n\n    context.popup(mainWindow); // Let it appear\n});\n```\n\nand in my renderer process\n\n``` javascript\n\nshowContextMenu() {\n    ipcRenderer.send('artistListContextMenu');\n}\n\ncomponentDidMount() {\n    ipcRenderer.on('artistListContextMenuReply', (event, reply) => {\n        console.log(reply); // Here is your reply from Menu API in the main process\n    });\n}\n\ncomponentWillUnmount() {\n    ipcRenderer.removeAllListeners('artistListContextMenuReply');\n}\n```\n\nIt moves a part of your logic in another place than your app. It's definetly not a best practice, but it works pretty well. An async version of `Menu.popup()` would clean this up.\n"
