    "body": "I use node-ipc for some other communications between my apps, but in this particular case I want to have the variable accessible somewhere. i.e. make a request to get it. If I use IPC I'd have to send the variable to all the apps that need it when it was created and when it's value changes, because I can't make an IPC request when I need it (as it won't be stored anywhere) and then store it locally for each application. Hence why the global text file feels easier to manage. It's literally going to be one word I'm storing and nothing else. Node cached seems like a possible option though. Thanks.\n"
