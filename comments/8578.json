Should the documentation describe accessing node APIs by re-introducing `ipcRenderer` in the pre-load scripts?\r\n\r\nOr are there some more fundamental, security-related caveats that I am unaware of?\r\n\r\nI do agree that this feature needs more detailed documentation that described the pros / cons. I'd happy to contribute.\r\n\r\n"
