    "body": "Thankfully, you don't need to create an asar archive to start an electron project.\nIn fact, if you install electron globally on your system, all you need is a package.json file with a `main: 'filePath'` entry that points to the bootstrap file.\nThen just run the command `electron .` in that directory and your app should attempt to start, provided you've set everything up correctly.\n\nI'd recommend reading the [Quick Start Guide](http://electron.atom.io/docs/latest/tutorial/quick-start/) to help orient you a bit with the standard development practices.\n"
