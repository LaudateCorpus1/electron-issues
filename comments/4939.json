    "body": "@zcbenz Sadly this isn't what I meant. While this will keep the last app focused, I'm not able to type in my app anymore.\n\nDo you use a Mac? If you open Spotlight (Cmd + Space) you will be able to type into Spotlight (i.e it captures all keyboard and mouse events) while the last app is still shown as \"focused\" (maybe this isn't the right term to describe it).\nWith focused I meant that the name of the last app is still displayed in the top left of the menubar. The windows actions buttons (close, hide, fullscreen) are also colored, which in OS X shows that the window is focused.\n\n<img width=\"159\" alt=\"bildschirmfoto 2016-03-31 um 14 23 45\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1564556/14175594/486037ae-f74c-11e5-9281-4b94403ad6d8.png\">\n"
