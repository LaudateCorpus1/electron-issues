    "body": "@zcbenz I understand the differences. However, now the deveopers have to deal with different file input from user in renderer and in menu. Right now, the only way to upload or read a file from `showOpenDialog` (let's say it's app menu) is to use node's `fs`. I can use `streams` to make this efficient, but I always have to handle this differently than file from file input or from drag and drop. Why not use the already implemented and optimized `File` stuff?\n\nI think this is totally valid scenario to consider. `main` and `renderer` can communicate, there should be a way to implement this. I am now \"hacking\" it around by having invisible file input in the renderer that's triggered from tha app menu. But this is stupid if Electron already has the dialog stuff.\n\nWhat do you think?\n"

    "body": "@zeke So I have hidden file input in renderer, I send ipc message from Main after user clicks on a menu item, the message is listened to in renderer and when it arrives I call `webFrame.executeJavaScript` where I click on the hidden file input.\n\nThis is on the page:\n\n``` html\n<input type=\"file\" id=\"file__hidden\" style=\"visibility: hidden\" multiple />\n```\n\nThis in the main process:\n\n``` js\nconst template = [\n  {\n    label: 'File',\n    submenu: [\n      {\n        label: 'Open Files',\n        click() {\n          mainWindow.webContents.send('hidden-file-input-open')\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n]\nMenu.setApplicationMenu(Menu.buildFromTemplate(template))\n```\n\nAnd this in the renderer:\n\n``` js\nipcRenderer.on('hidden-file-input-open', (e, args) => {\n  document.getElementById(\"file__hidden\").click() // this does not work\n\n  // this does work\n  const code = 'document.getElementById(\"file__hidden\").click()'\n  electron.webFrame.executeJavaScript(code, true)\n})\n```\n\nThe `true` in [webFrame.executeJavaScript](http://electron.atom.io/docs/api/web-frame/#webframeexecutejavascriptcode-usergesture) actually makes it work. It was suggested by @zcbenz in #6268. I hope you're not going to \"fix\" this possibility before there is a reasonable way to get instances of a File from dialog's `showOpenDialog()` ðŸ˜‰ \n\nI've cloned `electron-quick-start` and added all possible combinations of handling files in both main and renderer processes. It's at [jakubzitny/electron-file-hack](https://github.com/jakubzitny/electron-file-hack/blob/master/renderer.js).\n\nWe're talking about this issue in [electron Slack channel](https://atomio.slack.com/archives/electron/p1472241828003260), please join if you have anything to say.\n"
