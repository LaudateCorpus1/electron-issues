    "body": "FWIW, it seems like wrapping a call to `capturePage()` in `window.webContents.beginFrameSubscription()` guarantees that the backing store is up-to-date:\n\n``` js\nwindow.webContents.beginFrameSubscription(function(buffer) {\n  window.webContents.endFrameSubscription();\n  window.capturePage(rect, callback);\n});\n```\n\nObviously that's a pretty hacky workaround and actually having `capturePage` wait would be better, but for anybody experiencing this problem (I was pretty stymied by it for a few hours trying to use Nightmare.js to capture screenshots), it does seem to work.\n"
