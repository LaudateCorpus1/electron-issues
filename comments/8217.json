    "body": "WebGL is disabled on that system because Chromium blacklisted the Intel HD 3000 on macOS [a few months back](https://codereview.chromium.org/2076443002/), there's also a [related issue](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=644091) in the Chromium bug tracker. You could try running the app with the `--ignore-gpu-blacklist` [Chromium switch](http://electron.atom.io/docs/api/chrome-command-line-switches/), e.g.\r\n\r\n```\r\napp.commandLine.appendSwitch(\"ignore-gpu-blacklist\")\r\n```"
