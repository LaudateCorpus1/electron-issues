    "body": "That is a worthy challenge. In trying to come up a minimal example, I discovered that the changing of the window title is not related to Electron browser windows. Instead, it is a consequence of clicking on and navigating a link with href=`\"#\"`. Although that does not change the display, apparently Chromium makes an upcall saying that the document title has changed. Perhaps it should not do that, or perhaps Electron should ignore a change that duplicates the original file-based title when the application has replaced that title. In any case, suppressing the link navigation solved my problem.\n\nI should add that the upcall only happens the first time a link like this is navigated in a given browser window.\n"
