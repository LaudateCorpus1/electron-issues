    "body": "@MarshallOfSound Could you give hint on how to achieve that ? Correct me If I am wrong, there is no consistent behavior on which API should / should not return a promise. To make a generic solution more difficult, we need to selectively change error condition on certain APIs, e.g. do not throw error when there is no callback passed in as argument."
