If I leave away the `--no-sandbox` flag then I get a similar error as in https://github.com/atom/electron/issues/1348#issuecomment-91230583\n\n``` text\n[9784:0416/151609:ERROR:browser_main_loop.cc(170)] Running without the SUID sandbox! See https://code.google.com/p/chromium/wiki/LinuxSUIDSandboxDevelopment for more information on developing with the sandbox on.\nApp load time: 224ms\n...\nThe setuid sandbox is not running as root. Common causes:\n  * An unprivileged process using ptrace on it, like a debugger.\n  * A parent process set prctl(PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS, ...)\nFailed to move to new namespace: PID namespaces supported, Network namespace supported, but failed: errno = Operation not permitted\nThe program 'atom' received an X Window System error.\nThis probably reflects a bug in the program.\nThe error was 'BadWindow (invalid Window parameter)'.\n  (Details: serial 789 error_code 3 request_code 40 minor_code 0)\n  (Note to programmers: normally, X errors are reported asynchronously;\n   that is, you will receive the error a while after causing it.\n   To debug your program, run it with the --sync command line\n   option to change this behavior. You can then get a meaningful\n   backtrace from your debugger if you break on the gdk_x_error() function.)\n```\n\nMost likely setting the flag `--disable-setuid-sandbox` will be already sufficient so that Chromium correctly starts up, but of course from security aspect it's very critical to disable the sandbox or setuid-sanbox.\n\nWith Firefox as default browser I had no issues and `shell.openExternal` works for me. I've changed the default browser via `sudo update-alternatives --config x-www-browser`\n\nEdit: Maybe also this link helps for better understanding of the Chromium sandbox concept https://code.google.com/p/chromium/wiki/LinuxSUIDSandboxDevelopment\n"

    "body": "Not sure if it's a pure Chrome bug. If I run xdg-open directly from the shell with Chromium as default browser it works. Also in my example above https://github.com/atom/electron/issues/1348#issuecomment-94394011 I don't use xdg-open at all but still face the same issue. Seems like the Node process environment of electron doesn't behave well with Chromium so that it fails to run the setuid sandbox as root in case the Chromium process gets spawned out of electron (whyever Chromium wants to do such...)\n"
