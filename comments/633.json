    "body": "What is the status on video codecs for electron? Googling this is very confusing as there are a lot of tickets for this and each one references the other. I have tried to play various videos, some work, some don't, feels like 50/50. I stumble upon people saying you need to compile ffmpeg.so or copy it from chrome. As for the first option: This is kind of hard and i am wondering why nobody distributes their compiled .so files. Ultimately i did have no luck with this yet (and oh btw i wanna do an open source project so i have no licensing issues). The second option just did not work at all. \r\n\r\nSo is there a way to get (most) videos working? Even stuff like mpeg-4 and other [older but] commonly used codecs?"
