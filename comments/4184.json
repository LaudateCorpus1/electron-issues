    "body": "Thanks for awesome repro steps! \n\nI gave it a try and found the same issue you found when trying with Atom. Atom isn't on the latest Electron so I gave it a try with an app using the latest, `v0.36.4`, and was able to have the shortcut work as expected. \n\nWould you be able to try with the latest version?\n\nPSâ€”For what it's worth, I just learned about the [jiahaog/nativefier](https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier) app that turns a website into an Electron app quickly from the command line. You can specify the Electron version so I did that to spin up an Electron app using `v0.36.4`. Then I followed your keyboard shortcut steps to add a new shortcut to _undo_.\n\n```\n$ npm install nativefier -g\n$ nativefier \"http://medium.com\" -e 0.36.4\n```\n\n<img width=\"372\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-01-21 at 2 49 00 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1305617/12495653/23d1cb3a-c04e-11e5-8e06-47e1b5671a60.png\">\n"

I did try skimming the release notes between 0.35.0 and 0.36.4 to see if there was any mention of that kind of bug fix before I opened this issue, but I might have missed it. :blush: \n\nThanks for the quick reply!\n"
