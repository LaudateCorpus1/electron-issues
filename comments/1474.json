    "body": "It happens with the default_app which comes bundled with Electron. My app which is a bit heavier also loads faster on previous versions.\nStrangely enough it seems that only one specific machine is affected by this. I just tested on two more almost identical Windows installations and everything is fine there - latest version indeed loads faster. Weird.\n\nI guess we can close this as it doesn't seem like something reproducible...\n"
