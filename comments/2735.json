But our primary targets are mac & win for now. thanks for your reply.\n\nReally appreciate all your works.  I would love to dive in test the build. Is there any way i could do it. I guess i have to compile the atom project to get updated build. If there is any test build please point it to me. we would be glad to test it.\n\nThanks again.\n"
