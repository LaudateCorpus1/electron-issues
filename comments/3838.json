    "body": "> The first is that I wish to seek feedback on the approach of having the autoUpdater ask the app to emit the normal events rather than having the autoUpdater emit them itself.\n\nWe can probably add a parameter for `Browser::Quit`, so it can decide whether to use the original shutdown routine, or use `auto_updater::AutoUpdater::QuitAndInstall` to quit and restart the program.\n\n> The other reason I've stopped here is that I'm not sure how to test further shutdown events. If I let the shutdown process proceed to close the windows, I'll need to be able to reopen the testing window.\n\nIt is quite hard to write a reliable test case for this, I think it is fine to ignore that for now.\n"
