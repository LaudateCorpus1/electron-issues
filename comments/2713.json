    "body": "@carlosperate, thanks for the suggestion.\n\nAs I see it we have 3 options:\n1. Links for docs that are not translated will lead to the English docs (that's the solution offered in this PR). The disadvantage of this approach is that when you want to create a translation for a doc that is not currently translated, you also need to update the link in the index (README.md).\n2. Create docs with only a title and a link to the English translation for the missing docs. The disadvantage of this approach is that we need to create 38 extra files that don't really offer any content and the user need to click on 2 links to get to the actual content.\n3. Leave the links pointing to the path were the translation should be if it exists, which means that when you click those links you will get a \"page not found\" (404). The disadvantage of this approach is that most links will lead to 404 and the user will need to go back and search for the English doc (this is the current state). \n\nI personally prefer the first option, because it gives a good user experience (if you're looking for information you get it in one click) with minimal contributor cost (we don't need to create 38 files now, and the extra work for translating a single doc, is changing a single link).\n\n/cc @jlord, what do you think?\n"
