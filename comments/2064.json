    "body": "I figured that it only crashes when i use an incoming sendSync IPC connection, to forward to the `net` socket.\n\nA simplified example looks like this:\n\n``` js\nvar syncEvents = {};\n\n// create connection on \"ipcSocket\"\n\n// wait for data on the socket\nipcSocket.on(\"data\", function(data){\n    // SEND SYNC back\n    syncEvents['xyz'].returnValue = data.toString();\n});\n\nelectronIPC.on('ipcProvider-writeSync', function(event, payload){\n    ipcSocket.write(payload);\n    syncEvents['xyz'] = event;\n});\n```\n\nWhen i set the return value, it crashes.\nIf you do the same async, it works fine.\nHope that helps.\n"

And stop the net processes automatically, if possible.\n"
