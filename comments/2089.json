    "body": "Thanks @deepak1556!\n\nI've been digging a bit into this and here is a little more to go with what you just said. The kEnableFileCookies switch will eventually take you to a function in the CookieMonster class named SetEnableFileScheme(bool accept). This has been block by #if defined(OS_ANDROID) in our version of Chromium.\n\nNow looking at the comments are interesting:\n\n``` cpp\n  // Resets the list of cookieable schemes to kDefaultCookieableSchemes with or\n  // without 'file' being included.\n  //\n  // There are some unknowns about how to correctly handle file:// cookies,\n  // and our implementation for this is not robust enough (Bug 1157243).\n  // This allows you to enable support, and is exposed as a public WebView\n  // API ('CookieManager::setAcceptFileSchemeCookies').\n  //\n  // TODO(mkwst): This method will be removed once we can deprecate and remove\n  // the Android WebView 'CookieManager::setAcceptFileSchemeCookies' method.\n  // Until then, this method only has effect on Android, and must not be used\n  // outside a WebView context.\n```\n\nand this:\n\n``` cpp\n// This assumes \"file\" is always at the end of the array. See the comment\n// above kDefaultCookieableSchemes.\n//\n// TODO(mkwst): We're keeping this method around to support the\n// 'CookieManager::setAcceptFileSchemeCookies' method on Android's WebView;\n// if/when we can deprecate and remove that method, we can remove this one\n// as well. Until then, we'll just ensure that the method has no effect on\n// non-android systems.\n```\n\nSo perhaps we shouldn't even enable it via patching since it's not robust enough based on the comments above?\n\nReference:\n\nhttps://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git/+/43.0.2357.65/net/cookies/cookie_monster.h\nhttps://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git/+/43.0.2357.65/net/cookies/cookie_monster.cc\n"
