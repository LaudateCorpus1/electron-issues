    "body": "@zcbenz, I just checked what would happen if we would remove the special treatment of console.\\* and process.std*.write and let node handle it and everything worked. It even supported unicode correctly, but no colors.\nCould it be that some update to node fixed the old issues that made us replace it? Do you have some code I can try to reconstruct the old issues?\n"

But since we are suppressing that exception in recent versions, it is probably fine to remove the hacks.\n"
