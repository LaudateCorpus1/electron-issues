    "body": "Chromium/AtomShell uses [grit](https://code.google.com/p/grit-i18n/) for i18n, it basically works by putting translations in a XML file and convert it to `.pak` files, and then loads the `.pak` files in application and use some C++ APIs to read localized string from it. You can see examples at:\nhttps://code.google.com/p/chromium/codesearch#chromium/src/chrome/app/chromium_strings.grd&sq=package:chromium&type=cs\nhttps://code.google.com/p/chromium/codesearch#chromium/src/components/policy/resources/policy_templates_zh-CN.xtb&q=打开&sq=package:chromium&type=cs\n\nThe `grit` is mainly targeted for use in Chromium, and especially for C++ language, in Atom everything is JavaScript so using `grit` would be overkill.\n\nBecause all atom-shell apps are written in JavaScript, the i18n can be easily implemented via node modules, and it doesn't making any difference integrating it in atom-shell or making it external module. So I'm closing this since I don't think it should a builtin API in atom-shell.\n"

    "body": "@zcbenz I see a directory called _locales_ with many 0 KB `*.pak` files but I can't find any docs on localization in electron. Is there still no built-in l18n? What's the _locales_ folder for then?\n"
