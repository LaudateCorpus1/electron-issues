The easiest fix is to add a `width` and `height` to the body using units that aren't relative to content layout, i.e not `%`:\n\n``` css\nbody {\n    font-family: -apple-system, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif;\n    -webkit-app-region: drag;\n    width: 100vw;\n    height: 100vh;\n}\n```\n"
