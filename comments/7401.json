    "body": "@HiroTamori I think this bug is related to calling `show()` on a window that is a modal dialog multiple times causes issues. In that demo, there is a `win.show()` line but the window defaults to show as well and `NativeWindowMac::Show()` is getting called twice which is causing issues.\n\nIf I comment out the `win.show()` line the demo works fine for me, but this can be fixed in Electron by guarding against this case in `NativeWindowMac::Show()`.\n"
