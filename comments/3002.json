Basically create a native addon, feed the native window handle, call native APIs to create the vibrant view. It works on **Windows,MacOS** but see the readme about limitations,I'll eventually implement Linux version too.\n\nHere is a screenshot:\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/yvkK4mY.png)\n\nThe addon uses `SetWindowCompositionAttribute` on Windows 10, which is a private API, meaning that Microsoft can change this API any time and break the addons functionality. `SetWindowCompositionAttribute` is being used by OS for blurring behind the start menu, notification center etc.  \nHere is the addon [electron-vibrancy](https://github.com/arkenthera/electron-vibrancy)\n\nEdit: Updated to reflect current state of the addon.\n"
