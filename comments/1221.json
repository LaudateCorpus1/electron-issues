    "body": "@zcbenz  I have a work project that also makes heavy use of client certificates. It would be great if they could get implemented in Electron. \n\nWhile having Electron pull from the system keystore would be one step, it would also be useful if we could manually pass in a certificate that we bundle with our application. That way it wouldn't be necessary for our clients to install a separate certificate to access our system but we could still lock down access to our server just to people who are using the application.\n"

Ability to select client certificate from system store\n2. We'd really like the ability to provide the client certificate from a local pem/p12 (with passphrase) (this would have to happen before it defaults to the system store)\n3. @thojansen mentioned in the NW.js thread the ability to handle group policies for auto-selecting client certificates, it'd be great if this was implemented too\n\n1 is a must for this, but we'd love to have 2 and 3!\n\nHere's the NW.js thread for reference:\nhttps://github.com/nwjs/nw.js/issues/893\n\n[![Bountysource](https://www.bountysource.com/badge/issue?issue_id=9338919)](https://www.bountysource.com/issues/9338919-client-certificate-not-working?utm_source=9338919&utm_medium=shield&utm_campaign=ISSUE_BADGE)\n"
