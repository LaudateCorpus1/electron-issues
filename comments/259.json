The alternative is to make every Atom Shell user wait for a 2+ hour build and download 2+ GB of data.\n\nThe solution for CentOS users is _this bug_, because every other solution currently available for CentOS users involves building libchromiumcontent which sucks. We need to build (at least) libchromiumcontent on a bunch of distros.\n"

    "body": "My bug was merged here, but I'm confused about the technical details of this issue; as far as I can tell, this issue is where any distro-specific issues are getting merged? If this issue is for one specific problem, what is it? The only hard details I see are for linker issue from old versions of shared libraries. My distro **does** build libchromiumcontent itself, so we don't experience that. The issue we're getting is what looks like protection against undefined behavior, in a place that never appears in source code, and it's only on a certain kernel version.\n\nRefer https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/6842\nRefer https://github.com/tensor5/arch-atom/issues/34\n"
