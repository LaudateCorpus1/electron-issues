    "body": "In Electron each window has its own ID, so as long as you know the ID of target window you can use messages to arbitrary window with `ipc` module. In your case you can return the ID of new window to the window that created it, and in the new window you can also pass the ID of the window that created it, this way the two windows can easily communicate with each other.\n\nBut as @paulcbetts said, it needs an abstraction in Atom to make the whole thing easier, there are also [a few modules](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=electron+ipc) provided some wrappers.\n"
