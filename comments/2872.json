    "body": "Looks like --force-renderer-accessibility does cause some of the accessibility support to be enabled, but still lots missing. I tried it on VSCode, Atom and Slack, with varying degrees of success:\n- Events don't work; seeing error messages in console \"browser_accessibility_manager_win.cc: Not firing AX event because of no reoot_delegate or hwnd.\" The inspect tool can determine the HTML element under the mouse pointer and traverse the item tree, but neither it nor NVDA track keyboard focus.\n- The apps can end up taking a bit longer to start up; atom goes from warm start of ~8 sec on this slow VM to about 20s. ISTR that Chromium's accessibility support does have some perf cost, which is why it's off by default, so might just be hitting that.\n- NVDA doesn't work; likely related to the events issue, but NVDA navigation commands (eg. 'h' to move to next header) don't work either.\n\nNext step may be to investigate why focus and other events aren't being sent. Once that and other issues are addressed, ideal situation is that Electron would detect presence of a screenreader (eg. using the windows SystemParameterInfo(SPI_GETSCREENREADER) flag, or some other means), so that passing in the --force-renderer-accessibility flag shouldn't be needed -- but we likely don't want to enable that until the other issues are addressed.\n"
