    "body": "Actually we used to follow Node's behavior that quits the app when there is no listeners to uncaught exception, but the problem is we got LOTS of complaints that their apps just quit after an JavaScript exception, and we finally suppressed this behavior. \n\nI think current behavior is reasonable for GUI apps and not suitable for CLI apps, but Electron apps are mostly GUI apps and we should use the convention for GUI apps.\n"

    "body": "That makes sense actually, I was just expecting different behavior when Electron is spawned. Maybe an environment variable then? Which makes it not open a GUI dialog with the error, but instead logs it to stdout and then exits with the correct exit code. There are many use cases for spawning Electron, from headless testing, to my use-case of testing an Electron module I'm working on.\n"
