    "body": "On Windows, a single left click on tray icon will trigger the `clicked` event of `Tray`.\n\n@zcbenz , how about providing a `tray.popContextMenu()` API allowing developer to pop the context menu without user's interface. Currently we can implement this API on Windows and OS X(there is no such API in current Linux implements).\n\nWith this API, we can achieve this issue's feature via the following code:\n\n```\ntray.on('clicked', function() {\n   tray.popContextMenu();\n})\n```\n"
