    "body": "@adi518 @radarhere the problem is that when a window is maximized, Windows sets the X/Y to the negative frame width/height.  For example, I believe on Windows 10, it was -7/-7.  You can read more about [why Microsoft chose to do that here](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20120326-00/?p=8003).\r\n\r\nOne possible work-around, which I [captured here](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/5267#issuecomment-272607225) would be to manually override the min/max properties.  An alternative to that would be to put a handler on the WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGED and manually set the x/y to 0,0\r\n\r\nReverting https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/8404 would be a hack.  The reason that it seems to make the alignment work properly for the original post is because it forces the bounds frame (**even though this is a frameless window**).  Frameless windows should not have frames, IMO (even if they are not visible).  The change I made makes chromium use an inset (frame) of 0 (which is correct for frameless windows).\r\n\r\nDocking the taskbar to the top causes overflowed content to bleeds under the taskbar (as seen with https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/8546, except with taskbar being at bottom).  This is why I believe this issue is a dupe of https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/4045"

    "body": "@tonyganch @thesbros you're welcome to submit a PR which reverts https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/8404\r\n\r\nPer the PR's description, I work with Brave and we maintain a fork of Electron.  This patch was required for us starting with Chromium 54 to get rid of a solid white ~7px border around all edges of the screen for folks with larger than 100% DPI.  By returning an inset of 0, you're telling Chromium the client area is the same size as the window (which is true for frameless windows).  After we successfully released (our fork does not see this issue), I upstreamed the patch\r\n\r\nAt this point, I would recommend reverting https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/8404 if folks can test and ensure it looks correct (post-revert) when at 125%, 150% and 200% DPI\r\n\r\nTo get extremely specific, the [GetClientAreaInsets() method](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/atom/browser/ui/win/atom_desktop_window_tree_host_win.cc#L33) is only called when [calculating size for the non-client area](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git/+/56.0.2924.87/ui/views/win/hwnd_message_handler.cc#1722). Frameless Windows should *not* have client area (IMO) so https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/8404 returns a non-client (frame) size of 0.  When the window is created, [WS_THICKBORDER style is added for the sake of animations](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/dba154b06202c44bafd8e20feccd7033d805ff5e/atom/browser/native_window_views.cc#L284), etc which is what causes these NC events to process\r\n\r\n**The TL;DR:** \r\n- Frameless windows are not a raw WS_POPUP style (as I personally would expect they should be). They include styles which have a non-client area\r\n- Calculations for frame size in various bits of the electron code [attempt to remove the client area](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/dba154b06202c44bafd8e20feccd7033d805ff5e/atom/browser/ui/views/menu_layout.cc#L17)\r\n- Areas like maximizing the window (which causes negative x/y because of the frame) were missed\r\n- Reverting this will work, because Windows will set aside 7px (or whatever GetSystemMetrics returns) of dead space for the borders, which combats the -x/-y that happen because of being maximized with a frame\r\n- Removing the WS_THICKFRAME style should also work\r\n- People who have larger than 100% DPI might visually see the frame- they will actually paint the non-client area on top of whatever is inside the window (at least in my experience; we have diverged from libchromiumcontent, so it's possible this issue was already patched)"
