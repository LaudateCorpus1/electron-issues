    "body": "Note: This issue doesn't occur with recent electron-prebuilt versions, unfortunately upgrading right now won't work for our project. I was wondering if anyone was aware of what changed in the postinstall script that might have made it be able to run multiple times without errors. We may fork electron-prebuilt at 0.34.1 and work around this that way we have time to work through the issues we're having with upgrading electron.\n"
