I am using electron-packager to build my project and generate the executable apps. No errors happens during the electron-packager. The app(electron version is 1.6.7) works fine on SUSE12, but get an 'g_bytes_unref' error on SUSE11.4. Therefore, I try to downgrade the electron(1.3.1) and package again, still works fine on SUSE12, but get an 'GLIBC_2.12 not found' error on SUSE11.4\r\nBy the way, the version of glibc on SUSE11.4 is 2.11"
