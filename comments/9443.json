    "body": "> node.dll exports some symbols of the runtime, and when a native node module uses the dynamic runtime, it can mistakenly bind to those symbols instead of the ones from msvcp140 and friends. This ends up causing crashes when an object is initialized using one instance of the runtime and destroyed using the other instance.\r\n\r\nThis is actually blocking my current use case. If there's anything I can do to speed up a fix for this, that would be great. I can build myself but it complicates application distribution heavily (plus I'm not sure how to repackage the electron build since documentation on that seems to have been left out). \r\n\r\nI can also statically link against the VC++ runtime but that gives me almost no benefit while adding to my distribution size. Not cool. ;("
