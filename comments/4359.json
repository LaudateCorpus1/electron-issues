    "body": "@ArktekniK \n\nI personally think you'd get just as useful code protection from decent obfuscation. \n\nIt would however be helpful to get feedback from the team over what approaches would be most likely to be accepted as pull requests.\n\nThe simplest decryption code would probably go in `atom/browser/net/asar/url_request_asar_job.cc`. There's currently no way to flag a file in an asar as encrypted so this decryption would be applied to every file from every asar which would only be good enough for personal use.\n\nOne approach would require changes to asar. Add the encryption hook, add a header to show what encryption was used, add tests and then do a pull request. This feature has been [turned down before](https://github.com/atom/asar/issues/46) but it may be more likely to be accepted with code + tests. Bear in mind it does add functionality most will not use. The great thing with the design of asar is that the header is JSON so adding to it shouldn't break existing clients.\n\nAnother possibly cleaner approach requiring no changes to asar would be to encrypt the entire archive file and add new protocol handler to electron (see `atom/browser/net/asar/asar_protocol_handler`). The new handler would decrypt the stream and pass it into the existing asar code. There might be issues here with seeking within the stream and the decrypted file may need to be cached entirely in memory but this would only affect people using the feature.\n"
