    "body": "Someone will have to confirm this but I don't believe this is actually technically possible.  Currently the `sendToHost` method bounces through the main process (I believe).  So although the communication to the main process could be synchronous, the bounce back to the parent renderer processes can not be synchronous (as that could block the entire main process which is super bad idea).\n\nIMO you shouldn't be using `sendSync` anyway (as it introduces stutter / lag / framedrops) because it literally blocks the entire process while it waits for a response.  You should use an asynchronous request-response technique using `event.sender.send` üëç \n"
