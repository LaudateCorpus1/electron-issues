    "body": "FWIW, I ran into the same issue trying to use electron in the renderer process with create-react-app that uses webpack in the backend instead of browserify. ```window.require``` seems to solve it for me too though I'm not entirely clear why.\r\n\r\n**Edit**: I figured out why :-) We want to `require` `electron`  during runtime from the nodejs environment provided at the runtime rather than the nodejs environment used during compilation by webpack. By default, globals are bound to `window` and webpack compilation ignores the `window` global - hence `window.require` works.\r\n\r\nAnother way to tell webpack to ignore a global name is to use a comment like `/*global Android*/` in the JS file. In another project using CRA built app in an Android WebView, I used the above to get access to a Java object exposed to JS through the JavaScript interface provided by Webview."

    "body": "Yes my workflow currently is to basically run `npm run build` using the CRA scripts and then run the output in the `build` folder with electron. You don't need to modify the static resource paths by hand. In the `package.json` for CRA scripts, you just need to set the `homepage` like this and the paths will be appropriately set.\r\n```\r\n    \"homepage\": \"./\"\r\n```\r\nAdditionally, I have `main.js`  and `package.json` for the electron app in the `public` folder. So running the build automatically copies them over & you can just run `electron build/` to start your app.\r\n\r\nI'd actually like to be able to do the `npm start` with electron for development but I haven't gotten around to figuring how to make that work. I'm guessing i'll have to do an `eject` and modify the script by hand.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to seen an example of the setup - take a look at https://github.com/srinathh/snippetfu"
