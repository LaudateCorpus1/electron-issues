Because XLSX works perfectly in Chrome regular browser and in dev mode in electron.\n\nDon't you have a hunch what could possibly be different between dev mode and release?\n\nThis bugs me as it works perfectly in dev mode.\nAnd I have absolutely no Idea how to track this issue down.\n\nThe only things I can tell is:\n- the active browserWindow turns white\n- the window title remains, so I guess no new window was opened (?)\n- code inserted after the XLSX call does not run\n"
