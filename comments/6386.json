    "body": "That's a bit more than I can undertake at the moment. Looking through the code, ultimately the behaviour ends up dependent on that of Update.exe. I would set up a test of its behaviour if I could, but I can't do even that at the moment since it only runs on Windows. For now I have to rely on my experience with my complete app.\n\nWhat would happen is I would make an update to my app, and publish the RELEASES file and .nupkg files on my webserver. The app, running on the users' computers, would then present a notification of an update (once it had been discovered by autoUpdater.checkForUpdates()). Later when they would click the presented restart button, the app would throw an uncaught exception from autoUpdater.quitAndInstall(). Since there's only one way for this to happen, I have to assume that Update.exe --download only reports results that it has downloaded during its immediate execution, and not the sum total of elapsed updates since the currently running version. Which makes sense, since it's not being passed the version of the currently running program. Why would it report versions that are already installed?\n"
