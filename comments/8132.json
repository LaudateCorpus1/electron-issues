    "body": "@zcbenz Let me make it clear:\r\n\r\n1. `gvfs-trash` is officially **deprecated** (i.e. _dead_) by its creator. Why would anyone fix something that is already dead?\r\n\r\n2. Although `gio trash` is recommended as a replacement of `gvfs-trash`, `gio trash` has the same issue. Furthermore, both `gio trash` and `gvfs-trash` are **GNOME exclusive**, so non-gnome users won't be able to use \"Move to Trash\" feature out-of-the-box.\r\n\r\n3. Most popular Linux distros has trash-cli **by default**, so it makes sense to use command `trash`.\r\n\r\n4. In order to overcome this issue, electron apps developer can do some workarounds (e.g. try-catch for each 3 commands: `gvfs-trash`, `gio trash`, and `trash`). Almost (if not all) developers expect their apps to work right out-of-the-box so they must do it themselves instead of calling `moveItemToTrash`. Therefore, it makes sense to include these workarounds right in electron.\r\n\r\n5. I could report this bug to gvfs-trash. However, the difference between gvfs-trash and electron is: I could list `electron` as a `devDependencies`, so when electron fix this bug, I'll just increase electron version; I cannot specify gvfs-trash version."
