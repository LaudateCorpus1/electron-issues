    "body": "Ok, I've recreated this here: [electron-menu-role-bug.zip](https://github.com/electron/electron/files/414951/electron-menu-role-bug.zip)\n\nI'm creating two browser windows with `show: false`, loading the same URL for both, then showing the second (but not the first) in response to the'ready-to-show' event. The page they load has an input with a context menu for cut/copy/paste roles.\n\nJust do `npm install` then `./node_modules/.bin/electron .` as per the [quick-start guide](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/tutorial/quick-start.md).\n\nIf you then try to execute some context menu actions on the input of the visible (second) window, nothing will happen. This is because the first window's web contents is being pulled up as the 'focused web contents', and the actions are being executed against that. I've added some logs to try to demonstrate that.\n\nThis doesn't occur if the windows are created without `show: false`, so it looks like the root cause may be that the hidden window doesn't toggle it's focused state properly. I'm really not sure what the expected behaviour of that is though.\n"
