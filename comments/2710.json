    "body": "> I think we should reconsider using a CI for Windows so we can catch issues like this faster. From what I understand the reason it's currently disabled is that building on appveyor takes over 30 minutes. appveyor states in their FAQ that if you purchase a \"Pro\" or \"Premium\" plan you'll get dedicated hardware with faster CPUs, SSD drives, 1 GB network uplink. So maybe we can contact them and see if we can try running the build on the stronger machines.\n\nWe have Windows CI running on GitHub's own server, but it does not test pushes by non-GitHubbers for security reasons, so for now I can only verify Electron builds on Windows when I push.\n\nAlso considering the super-bad performance of appveyor's free plan, it still won't be usable unless their Pro plan can get more than 10x faster. And since there is no mention of machine specifications on appveyor's website, I'm not even willing to have try (faster CPUs means nothing to me).\n"
