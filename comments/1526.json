    "body": "I've only heard about electron as of today. Checking it out on github, saw this issue and thought \"Oh, maybe I can go fix the File Path example as a real quickie.\"\n\nBut comma shouldn't have anything to do with your fix, as console.log takes a comma separated list of objects.\n\nIn fact, I just made a barebones electron app, copied the File Path example you linked as-is, and it worked fine with the comma.\n\nWonder what other change you could have made to make it work.\n\nThat [example code I made is here](https://github.com/thebouv/electron-file-example-fix)\n\n(and you closed the issue while I posted this, so this is probably all moot, but was fun to build the example anyway)\n"
