    "body": "Thanks for your response. I've added some code in the browser index.html to grab the app/node_modules path via IPC and append it to `module.globalPaths`. This fixes my issue.\n\nI just wanted to point out that this example does use `file://` throughout though:\n- Protractor starts electron, which loads `file://[projectDir]/app/index.html`.\n- It then loads the reset page, which is configured to be another file url: `file://[projectDir]/e2e-tests/reset.html`.\n- And finally, it executes a javascript `window.location.replace(\"file://[projectDir]/e2e-tests/../app/index.html?test=protractor\");`\n\nAnd when the final page is loaded, it has lost its directory.\n\nJust running this directly doesn't trigger the problem though. It has to be via the selenium driver.\n"
