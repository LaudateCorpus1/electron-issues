    "body": "> I would expect the navigator.webkitTemporaryStorage. to report zero, and the navigator.webkitPersistentStorage to report the size of the stored data.\r\n\r\nI believe its mostly because we grant unlimited storage by default to all origins. Anyway those apis are going away soon after `navigator.storage.estimate` becomes stable https://storage.spec.whatwg.org/ .\r\n\r\n> If you're sure about this, then there should be no issue. I just wonder why navigator.webkitPersistentStorage is telling me otherwise.\r\n\r\nYes I am sure, if it doesn't work then its definitely a bug. There is no easy way to test on user land, I can only verify that the origins storage are not evicted following chrome's policy similar to https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/storage/browser/quota/quota_database_unittest.cc?l=146"
