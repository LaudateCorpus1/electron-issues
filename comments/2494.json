To try to reproduce the problem I added a breakpoint to `module.js` and used a bare `require('winston')` from the devtools console. Same end result, but I hope that doesn't skew the output.\n\n![screen shot 2015-08-18 at 8 12 58 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/786640/9330829/6bc25b64-4581-11e5-826d-e1b0d65abfc6.png)\n\nIn the failure case the parent module is coming from the `atom.asar`.

I'lll post back when I resolve.\n\n**UPDATE**: It turned out to be 1. `auth0-lock` has implicit dependencies on other packages they dont bring in; 2. browserifying the things for dep management solved it.\n\nI just ran into this with Electron v0.30.6 on OSX 10.10.3. \nHere is what I ran from my project root : `./node_modules/.bin/electron .`\n\nHere are the results of \n\n``` js\n// inside index.html\nrequire('module').globalPaths.forEach(console.log.bind(console))\n```\n\nIt looks like my apps `node_modules` folder isnt in the module paths in the renderer process?
