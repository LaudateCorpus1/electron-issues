    "body": "@sapjax Do you know how nw.js solves this? Do you have an example what works?\n\nProperly speaking, the caption area of a window has more to it than just moving the window around. From a _Windows_ perspective, a caption area is brought into being by looking at the cursor coordinates and returning `HTCAPTION` when handling a `WM_NCHITTEST` window message (which usually occurs in combination with a mouse event).\n- [x] Moving of the window\n- [x] Double-click maximizes the window (restores the window respectively).\n- [x] [Aero snap](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/e7/archive/2009/03/17/designing-aero-snap.aspx)\n\nApart from Aero snap, everything can be emulated (more or less painfully).\n\n:bulb:\nHow about adding something like a `non-client-hit-test` event to `BrowserWindow`. That way the developer would be able to implement it's own logic to tell the operating system which part of the window is the caption area, client area, maximize button etc.\n\nI don't know about OS X and Linux though ...\n"
