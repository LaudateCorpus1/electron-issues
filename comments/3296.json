If you don't already have a page that includes all the images, then you'll need to add a php page that dynamically creates `img` tags for all your images (`savePage` with `saveType=HTMLComplete` will download all page assets). You might want to run it in a separate BrowserWindow with `show` set to false, so it won't hurt the performance on an existing window.\n"

    "body": "Hi, @etiktin! Thanks for your answer! I think your idea is better than mine. I was thinking about creating an archive of all existing images each time I upload a new image, then download it and extract it locally when the app syncs.\nBut I will try your idea, because it seems better to me.\nI really need to download the images, because I want to be sure that the app will run ok no matter what will happen. \n"
