    "body": "OK, I traced it down. The problem lies in Facebook using `window.unbeforeunload` to prevent and confirm closing the window with unsaved/unsent input.\n\n`window.unbeforeunload` [is overridden by Electron](http://electron.atom.io/docs/api/browser-window/#event-close) to silently prevent closing the window on any non-`undefined` return value from the event handler.\n\nThe above behavior is reasonable in case `nodeIntegration = true` however when it's off, I'd expect this to behave more like on web browsers, where a confirmation dialog is shown.\n\nI dumped the un-minified Facebook dialog and my test app [into this repo](https://github.com/salomvary/tmp-fb-on-electron) for further investigation. It also contains a [trivial test page](https://github.com/salomvary/tmp-fb-on-electron/blob/master/test.html) to showcase the behavior.\n\nThinking of workarounds, one possible solution would be hijacking `window.addEventListener('beforeunload')` and the `window.onbeforeunload` setter and wrapping whatever is added there with an Electron dialog implementation in a `preload` script added to all `BrowserWindows` opened. \n"
