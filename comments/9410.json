    "body": "Current Debug version of Electron is more like a version that builds quickly so it should be probably called \"Development\" version. To provide a real Debug version we would need to provide Debug versions of prebuilt binaries of libchromiumcontent, which we wouldn't like to do but haven't done yet.\r\n\r\nPull requests are welcomed if you are interested in working on this."
