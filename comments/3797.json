First I would like to congratulate you on the project and also leave here my desire as well as many others to see the electron running in the FresBSD, your application is very impressive and it would be great if you could add support to FreeBSD I very much enjoyed the platform and it would enable the BSDS systems to leverage enabling the creation of incredible apps."
