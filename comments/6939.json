Default is true.\n\nIt means by including nodeintegration attribute, by default it will value will be ture. But we can set it to false by doing nodeintegration=\"false\".\n\nAs there is no, on/off so it should not work.\n\nAnd about `<webview nodeintegration=\"nada\">`, I have a doubt how to check whether the  nodeintegration is working or not.\n\nI will edit and submit a pull request soon for the same.\n"
