    "body": "The same with me. I also have an application with slides for videos and images that is intended to run on the Pi2 and Pi3. However, my stack is a little bit different, including AngularJS and some custom directives.\n\nMy application also runs fine in linux x86 and x64 versions, although on the RPi the **videos (with any resolution) becomes oddly lagged**. As @goktugerce has posed, I also learned that Pi's GPU is accessed via OpenMAX API but somehow the built-in browser on electron does not seem to take advantage on that, instead relying only on the CPU for decoding.\n\nAny help would be great. _Is there any chance that electron could support this in a near future?_\nEven if not, anyone could help me to build a customized version with this support?\n"

    "body": "Unfortunately Chromium doesn't implement video acceleration for the hardware used by Raspberry Pi, I would like to fix this, but the work would be really huge, and none of us in Electron actually knows how to do that.\n\nI suggest opening an issue at Chromium's [issues list](https://crbug.com) instead, I'm closing this since it is an upstream issue, and we are not able to fix it on Electron's side.\n"
