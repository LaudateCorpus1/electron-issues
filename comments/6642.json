That's my bad, we had tried the website and it apparently loaded but I think they may have subtly loaded the `www` endpoint for that page, which correctly loads in the webview.\n\nI guess, the second part still occurs, but I personally haven't been able to recreate it. I watched the user consistently get the application to crash and it tended to appear when loading that URL in the webview and trying to copy/paste something in the parent page. I'm still trying to get more details on other times where the copy/paste crashes to help narrow it down.\n\nThe electron application itself is basically bare bones and only loads an HTML page which contains webviews inside of it. We have set up an Edit menu with the regular edit items in it which work, except for this one user and only sometimes crashes.\n"
