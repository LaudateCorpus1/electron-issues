[The relevant line is here](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git/+/b8f8f682a82bce992edb35c3030214ede236d3ba/build/common.gypi#705).\n\nActually I am testing on a Linux box for that, too. My current development box runs [Elementary OS](http://elementary.io/), and whenever a Gtk2 application is executed it would display a warning `Gtk-Message: Failed to load module \"pantheon-filechooser-module\"` ([Ref](http://elementaryos.stackexchange.com/questions/1859/gtk-message-failed-to-load-module-pantheon-filechooser-module)). If things go smooth (hopefully) let's see if I can get a PR too. Would definitely love your inputs there though.\n"

Been committed to other projects off GitHub, my bad.\n\nBack to our case, that was what I originally think should work, but mysteriously fails to build proper Gtk3 applications on my box. In my case, my original intention is to make an Electron build that would not emit error under my development box (which is running Elementary OS Freya). However it seems building that way won't really make the warning go away.\n"

    "body": "I am no expert on this field, and not sure if I have misapprehended @zcbenz's comment; just my 2 cents.\n\nRegarding the questions:\n1. Probably not. [libchromiumcontent](https://github.com/atom/libchromiumcontent) seems, from the look of it, a bunch of scripts that [downloads chromium source from upstream](https://github.com/atom/libchromiumcontent/tree/599c8941e1884e155218ec1013cba9fc5c7c7072/script/download), [patches](https://github.com/atom/libchromiumcontent/tree/599c8941e1884e155218ec1013cba9fc5c7c7072/script/apply-patches), and [repackages](https://github.com/atom/libchromiumcontent/tree/599c8941e1884e155218ec1013cba9fc5c7c7072/scripts/create-dist) for use in Atom. Apart from changing a flag on chromiumcontent.gypi as you have mentioned, at least [dependency libraries are packaged properly as well](https://github.com/atom/libchromiumcontent/blob/599c8941e1884e155218ec1013cba9fc5c7c7072/script/create-dist). See the instances of `libgtk2ui`.\n2. There are [fragments in Electron that references to libgtk2-specific UIs](https://github.com/atom/electron/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=libgtk2ui). Those point to a dependency within chromium (and/or derivatives). \"Links\" as in @zcbenz's comment probably refer to those.\n\nThe [tracking bug on Chromium](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=79722) reflects some sort of status from upstream. One of the commenters note:\n\n> IIRC, it would require building a libgtk3ui library to match chrome/browser/ui/libgtk2ui/, and have these two libraries switched at startup time.\n\nAnd, as of writing, libgtk3ui does not exist yet :( [You may have a look at the code on libgtk2ui as well.](https://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/chrome/browser/ui/libgtk2ui/)\n"

    "body": "I was between personal laptops after I originally posted this and had been using my company issued MBP for a handful of months since. But I finally have my new machine, downtime and decided to take a stab at this.  My progress thus far:\n\nI was able to get libchromiumcontent to build with gtk3, it entailed the following:\n- add `'use_gtk3': 1` in chromiumcontent.gypi.\n- disabled sysroot by manually commenting out the call for `install_sysroot()` in script/update. Note: Depending on the libchromiumcontent version, you might need to set `use_sysroot` in `chromium/src/build/common.gypi` to `'use_sysroot': 0`. I'm assuming the right approach in the future would be to switch to debian_jessie for cross-compiling ability in builds?\n- ran pkg-config:\n\n``` shell\npkg-config --cflags gtk+-3.0 wayland-protocols gl egl glib-2.0 x11 gdk-3.0 gmodule-2.0 gthread-2.0 gtk+-unix-print-3.0 libpulse atk --libs gtk+-3.0 wayland-protocols gl egl glib-2.0 x11 gdk-3.0 gmodule-2.0 gthread-2.0 gtk+-unix-print-3.0 libpulse atk && export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/lib/pkgconfig:/usr/share/pkgconfig\n```\n- ran `script/update -t x64 && script/build -t x64 && script/create-dist -t x64`\n- waited for hours :)\n\nHowever,  I was unfortunately a little too optimistic after the build finished, thinking it be a drag n' drop for an electron build, but of course it wasn't.  I think the next step is to get a local brightray built out and whatever other gyp files updated to use my system libs and not sysroot. \n\nAnd in regards to the libgtk2ui - I'm having trouble locating the reference to where I read this (maybe gentoo forums, chromium issue tracker or an arch linux community thread) - but I believe that Chromium builds the libgtk2ui regardless of gtk3/gtk2 because the devs were doing the bare minimum to get a build with gtk3 to work. I could be wrong and I don't know how this might effect any Electron-based patches that were written specifically for gtk2.\n\nI do a weekly chromium-gtk3 build for my personal browser and libgtk2ui is still present and I'm assuming used.\n\nI'll come back here hopefully in the next few days and link to my POC repo's with prebuilt binaries and some screencaptures.\n"

GTK2 is not useable on HiDPI systems (at least not with ubuntu 16.04) due to all of the icons in buttons and toolbars being rendered extremely small. Fortunately in Atom's case this seems to affect only the file open dialog, at least as far as I can see, so Atom itself remains fairly useable.\n"

    "body": "@EiNSTeiN I will link back shortly to an electron-gtk3 repo by weekend's end.  \n\nA little backstory first - the main reason why I was determined to get this working was because I use Atom as my daily driver and couldn't stand to see the file dialog anymore! However, that build took longer than expected due to complications with asar/compiled-cache/npm-not-running-post-install-scripts, but I'm good to go now.\n\nI had been mulling over the best way to do this - so maintainers will have a good reference(it'd be tough coordinating pull requests in all the individual repo's) and also so gtk3-would-be-users could get up and running as quickly impossible. \n\nBut I won't be doing automated builds, so everyone should be prepared for 4-6 hour build times or to get some servers ready. I might end up doing the occasional release until these changes are reflected in the official repo.\n\nI've narrowed in on making a repo with electron as a submodule and writing a single bash script for building electron with all the gtk3 goodness. Then every distro can have an easy starting point to eventually distributing packages until these changes are actually in offically.\n\nAnd onto the hidpi note - my exec cmd for `atom-gtk3` is `GTK_THEME=Adwaita:dark GDK_SCALE=2 GDK_DPI_SCALE=.5 /usr/local/share/atom/atom --force-device-scale-factor=1.5 %U`. The GDK scale flags also fix `chromium-gtk3` ui font sizing.

Note that it builds only the `release` version unless you specifically tell it to build both `debug` and `release`. check out the README and open an issue if something isn't working.\n\n@zcbenz is there any historical reason in using Debian Wheezy (I know Chromium likes to be LTS compatible)? Maybe adding a build flag to use Jessie/GTK3?  I could work on a proper pull request if you aren't opposed to the idea, otherwise you atleast have a reference build script on what it takes to get GTK3 to build.\n\nEdit: @tensor5 are you using X or Wayland? I know chromium gtk3 builds are crashing on key input events in Wayland.\n"
