    "body": "Yes, here is one way though I haven't specifically tried Edge.JS in Electron but I have in Node-Webkit. Theoretically it should work. \n\nhttp://tjanczuk.github.io/edge/\n\nGranted using Edge.JS requires a little more effort to call directly into Win32 because you'll have to go through .NET first. If you need specific Win32 you can P/Invoke them from .NET and then call the .NET using Edge.JS from JavaScript within your app.\n\nIf you decide to try out Edge.JS and have some issues getting it to work I could probably be bothered to help since I am interested in this kind of stuff and have done some work to make it work in Node-Webkit here -> https://github.com/frankhale/nw-edge-example\n\nOr (another way requiring a bit more effort)\n\nThere is always the option to write a Node module that provides the necessary Win32 API's wrapped up in a JS API that you can call from your app. \n"
