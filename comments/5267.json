There are then two approaches for solving in electron:\r\n1. Update [native_window_views_win.cc](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/atom/browser/native_window_views_win.cc#L89) and handle the `WM_GETMINMAXINFO` event in `PreHandleMSG()`.  You'll be able to [get the coords](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms632626(v=vs.85).aspx) from the `l_param` and can update them to be the expected values (x/y of 0,0 instead of -7,-7) and set `*result` to 0 / return true.\r\n2. In the constructor for [`native_window_views.cc`](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/atom/browser/native_window_views.cc#L283), unfortunately `WS_THICKFRAME` (among other styles such as `WS_CAPTION` and extended styles) are passed in (which trigger incorrect frame calculations). These styles can be removed completely and resizing still does work properly (at least in my testing). This would be my suggested approach."
