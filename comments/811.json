    "body": "Implementing this requires setting the internal representing filename to `file://blabla`, which is fine for most cases since it is only used when displaying the line of error or listing the scripts in the page.\n\nHowever this causes troubles when throwing an exception from `.coffee` file, because CoffeeScript is very smart to translate the filenames in stack trace from `.js` to `.coffee`, and it can not recognize `file://blabla`, so one it met one it would throw exceptions.\n\nWe can work around this by either patching CoffeeScript or making necessary node APIs recognize `file://blabla`, but it is too much for such a simple feature, so I'm reverting the fix and marking this as won't fix.\n"
