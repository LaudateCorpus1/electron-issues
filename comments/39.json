    "body": "Node's implementation of `setImmediate` and `process.nextTick` use `uv_check_start` to schedule the callback to run in the next iteration of uv loop, which doesn't make atom-shell to wake up the uv loop, because it's not a real os event and would not make `kevent` return. I'm seeing if I can get a decent patch and send a PR to upstream libuv.\n\nAnd I'll also add automatic tests for atom-shell to avoid breaking fixed bugs again.\n"
