    "body": "Being a header-only library, NAN itself does not care about the ABI. As far as I know, there have been no significant API breakage in V8 5.1 either. Moreover, if NAN did not work, it would almost surely refuse to compile. Thus, NAN is almost surely compatible with V8 5.1. However, none of this applies when using prebuilt binaries of incompatible ABIs.\n\nI am fairly certain that the problem here is ABI related and that the alleged rebuild does not properly build against the V8 version included in Electron, which for all I know could still be different from what is picked up by node-gyp operating on the bundled Node, which does not seem to use its bundled V8 under Electron. That the observed problem could not be reproduced on Windows, which does not support prebuild, points towards this.\n\nThere is no apparent reason why `Nan::Null`, which does nothing but forward to `v8::Null` would evaluate to `true`. It simply makes no sense, unless there is an ABI incompatibility. One possibility is that the attempts to rebuild the Node addon were built against the V8 version bundled in the bundled Node, which is not what Electron uses. It could also have been built against some other V8 version on the local file system. Who knows.\n"

When using the wrong V8 version, like Electron does, this ends up returning `true` instead of `null`, since the ABI changed and `true` is now located at index 7.\n"

This is going to be a new norm for Node in its \"Current\" release lines so Electron is going to need a strategy for dealing with this going forward.

It's true that over time there will continue to be multiple overlapping Node.js versions to support but that will simplify even further later this year when 0.10 and 0.12 reach EOL.\n\n> as well as different platforms that are not 100% ABI compatible with node.js (nw.js, electron),\n\nThis is what `NODE_MODULE_VERSION` is supposed to solve. Electron was, originally, using a totally different `NODE_MODULE_VERSION` (by adding >100 to it) and I think nw.js might still be. The problem here is that Electron has moved back to the same number as Node which is precisely why this problem is coming up. Either we need to bridge some of the gaps between Node and Electron (which I'm _very_ keen to do fwiw) or Electron needs to use a different number so that this isn't a problem. The only reason you're identifying node-pre-gyp as a problem in this particular instance is because of this numbering, it's indicating an ABI compatibility while it's actually incompatible. We just need to fix that one way or another. The two obvious paths are for Electron and Node to move in lock-step in ABI compatibility or for Electron to use a different `NODE_MODULE_VERSION` .. of course introducing yet another `NODE_MODULE_VERSION` gets back to the problem you identified of version proliferation and I think, at this stage at least, Electron would lose out, with addon developers shipping binaries for the Node suite but not for Electron, and Electron users being forced to compile. But at least they wouldn't have an ABI conflict which is usually more difficult for users to grok.\n"

Our current plan, as long as we don't notice any unexpected regressions, is to ship node v7 with it.\n\nSeeing as how in node v6 we bumped V8 5.0 to 5.1, I don't think it unreasonable to expect us to continue to have a modern V8 in all upcoming node releases, assuming we can do so without breaking ABI. At the very least we will be attempting to have the latest V8 in every semver major release.\n\nI would really love to see if node + electron can collaborate on this to see if we can avoid have mismatches in `node module version`.\n\nThere is of course the possibility that this is not exactly tenable based on the pace that ya'll need to keep chromium updated, but perhaps some sort of more reasonable cadence can help keep the delta between the electron node and upstream smaller.\n"

For the foreseeable future Electron is going to bump the node module version for every stable Chrome/V8 release, so future node module versions in Electron are predictable:\n\n| Electron Version | NODE_MODULE_VERSION | V8 Version |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1.2.0 | 48 | 5.1 |\n| 1.3.0 | 49 | 5.2 |\n| 1.4.0 | 50 | 5.3 |\n| 1.5.0 | 51 | 5.4 |\n\nAnd Electron bumps the minor version usually within a short time after a new Chrome stable releases, so when Electron bumps the node module version can be predicted by using Chrome's release calendar: https://www.chromium.org/developers/calendar.\n"

    "body": "> and at that point the expectation would be that the V8 version no longer dictates the `NODE_MODULE_VERSION`. It would be best to avoid tight coupling between V8 version and `NODE_MODULE_VERSION`.\n\nAt the very least, there’s going to be a transition time in which many addons don’t use the new native API. It might make more sense to just start another counter that can be incremented specifically when the new ABI/API changes?\n"
