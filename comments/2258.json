    "body": "@bpasero There are two types of buttons in the native dialog: custom buttons like \"Save All\" and stock buttons like \"Cancel\", and there are two ways of showing them: displaying as links or buttons. Currently Electron identifies stock buttons from their labels and shows them as buttons, the other buttons are treated as custom buttons and are showed as links.\n\nIdentifying stock buttons can add some goodies to the dialog: some buttons will have accelerators associated, and they will be localized automatically. But the downside is Windows always separates stock buttons from custom buttons, even if we show custom buttons as buttons in the dialog, the sequence of buttons would become a mess.\n\nSo I chose to show custom buttons as links in Electron, and the results turned out to be quite well, for your \"Shutdown\" dialog as example, I think it actually matches the style of other modern Windows apps?\n\nOr maybe I should provide options to let users have complete control of how the dialog shows? I think the safest choice is to treat all buttons as custom buttons and show them as buttons.\n"
