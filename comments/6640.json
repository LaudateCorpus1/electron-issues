    "body": "CEF is a very good example for wrapping Chromium APIs, and we used it to implement node-webkit and Atom editor before atom-shell, but eventually we moved to use Chromium content module because we needed to access details of Chromium API and we even had to patch Chromium to expose certain features.\n\nAnd we then developed the brightray library to abstract certain parts of Chromium to make it easier for constructing apps based on Chromium, and it had been used by a few internal apps and the Breach browser, but all of those projects are dead now.\n\nI think it is a good idea to have a compatibility layer for Chromium, but it would take too much efforts to construct one that can meet Electron's usages, I would expect a 5 people Chromium experts team spending two months to get a prototype working. \n"
