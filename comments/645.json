Leaving info here for posterity.\r\n\r\nCalling `window.open()` will open a new BrowserWindow with the same configuration options as the window calling it. In my case, I had this code:\r\n```\r\nvar mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({ show: false });\r\nmainWindow.loadURL(`file://${__dirname}/files/index.html`);\r\nmainWindow.once('ready-to-show', mainWindow.show);\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich has the window initially hidden. This means when calling `window.open` the new window is hidden initially, appearing to not work. Removing the `{ show: false }` fixes the issue. I'd still like to figure out how to keep that option but not have it apply to new windows."
