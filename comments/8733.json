Perhaps this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  * `cancelId` Integer (optional) - The index of the button to be used to cancel the dialog, via\r\n    the `Esc` key. By default this is assigned to the first button with \"cancel\" or \"no\" as the\r\n    label. If no such labeled buttons exist and this option is not set, `0` will be used as the\r\n    return value or callback response. This option is ignored on Windows.\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr have I misunderstood the desired/expected behaviour?"
