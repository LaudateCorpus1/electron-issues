(See screenshot.) For our purposes, I think a single change would suffice: in place of an array of items, allow `submenu` to be a function which returns items, which is called when the submenu is about to be displayed.\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1037212/14754939/6df12124-0893-11e6-8d63-70fc4991774a.png)\n\nWould be interested to hear other specific use cases for menu delegates that folks have in mind. \n"

    "body": "I'm trying to implement a \"recent items\" feature and I'm having difficulties adding/removing MenuItems at run-time. I came across this comment here https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/608#issuecomment-54026327, which led me here. I just wanted to confirm that there is at the moment no way to dynamically add and remove MenuItems or if I'm just doing something wrong. Specifically, I'm trying to add and remove MenuItems from a submenu collection of another MenuItem.\r\n\r\nHowever, `menuItem.submenu.append(new MenuItem{})` seems to add the items, but they only become visible after a state change of the parent, i.e. enabling then disabling it.\r\n\r\nThank you."
