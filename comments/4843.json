I suspect optimising for a more intuitive API vs exposing the underlying mechanism makes more sense in this case.\n\nThat said, I agree with collapsing 4 distinct events down to one event with an enum argument; the main reason I didn't initially was to avoid dealing with passing around arguments in the internals.\n"
