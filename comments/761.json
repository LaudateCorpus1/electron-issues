It would be really awesome to have native toolbars in Windows too as well as other native controls like tree views, list views, data grids, etc. If it doesn't get done in the core Electron project, I'm sure somebody will find a way. Edge.js would be one way to integrate higher level UI bindings via .NET/Mono so you could mix Electron with .NET+WinForms/WPF on Windows and Mono+Cocoa on OS X.\n\n@max could you explain what you mean by \"inability to customize `NSToolbar`\"? Do you mean the developers inability to customize it or the end-user?\n\nThe image that you attached looks like it could be done with HTML since it's not drawing in the reserved area (title bar) of the window. (But I'm with you - I really don't want to emulate native stuff in HTML if I don't have to because it's a moving target and breaks easily.)\n"
