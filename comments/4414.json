    "body": "Ok this is a bit of a pain. I can't see how anyone has achieved this programmatically.\n\nNative modules are a pain on Windows. That module I linked above fails on install for me. It's not clear how to do this manually. Not even a viable option anyway though. I'd settle for bundling in an `.exe` and calling it with args, but I don't want to have to write C++/C#. The only remaining options I see are:\n1. Use the \"balloons\" notifications from the Tray API (assuming the work fine on Windows 8 too). That's not really nice though.\n2. Create custom HTML ones yourself with Electron Windows. Not nice.\n3. If you were using something like InnoSetup or NSIS or some other installer, maybe _maybe_ they might be able to create a shortcut with an app ID and put it in the right place. This has the downside though that it's only run once. It's nice that it's in your app with NW.js because:\n   - It can tweaked in automatic updates.\n   - You could check if it's there everytime your app starts and if not, create it. So it doesn't matter if the user deletes it. Whereas if you use an installer to do this, it's only do once ever.\n"
