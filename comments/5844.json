Setting them all to use .png fixed notifications for me.\n`appIcon = new Tray(__dirname + '/images/icon.png');`\n`appIcon.displayBalloon({\n      icon: __dirname + '/images/icon.png',\n      title: data.title,\n      content: data.message,\n    });`\n\nIf it's any help, I initialized my Tray instance during the app ready event, and displayed tray balloons when an event from my renderer process was received by ipcMain.\n\nA thing to note is that even as the balloon icon was set, somehow notifications aren't consistently provided an icon: \n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15341353/19026558/f0d7155c-8959-11e6-8c7b-53a064c19920.png)\n"
