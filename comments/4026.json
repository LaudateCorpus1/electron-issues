Electron doesn't have Chromes sandbox and there might be inadvertent ways into the node code even with node integration off.  E. G.  That icon I mentioned allows a remote page to get node to load a file from the file system. \n"

But I don't think that a false sense of security is a reason to not make improvements to security where possible.\n\nIn this case I think we could even close the hole you mention. What about, if Node integration is off in the parent, having certain features—not just `nodeIntegration`, but also `icon` and perhaps other `BrowserWindow` options—be ignored in calls to `window.open`? (And have the new window just inherit those options from the parent.)\n"
