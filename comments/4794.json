In the link you gave to the nacl documentation, they have:\n\n```\n// The NaCl module embed is created within the listenerDiv\nvar listenerDiv = document.getElementById('listener');\n```\n\nSo in their example they are placing the `<embed>` as a child of the `listenerDiv` which means the `message` event will bubble up.  In your example code this is not the case (your `listener` div is a sibling of the `embed`) so it never receives that event.\n"
