    "body": "As far as I know, at least on Mac, Atom will correctly read the environment variables if you start it from the terminal. I've just tested:\n\n``` bash\n$ atom\n$ PATH=$PATH:/ermahgerd atom\n```\n\nBoth of these give the desired result - the first is my full PATH, and the second my PATH with the ermahgerd directory.\n\nHowever, if you start Atom normally by clicking its application icon, it doesn't inherit your user environment. If Atom is already open, and you use the `atom` shell command, it will not inherit your user env because it uses the existing Atom process. Did you leave Atom open while testing the shell command?\n"

At least, it works in some cases, such as for making sure binaries are available for subprocessing. For things where the binaries are needed on startup, not so much, due to the timing of the init script.\n\nI would honestly really prefer that the Atom preferences had some way to specify PATH within the application as well.

    "body": "We've never had full access to e.g. `$PATH` when executing from outside of a shell, but starting in Yosemite, inheriting `$PATH` when launching apps from the terminal has regressed. I've confirmed this with several developers on other OS X applications (RStudio, iTerm2, and others). A bug has been opened with Apple, but this might never get fixed. In particular the problem seems to be with setenv(3) in correlation with NSTask, but I haven't got the specifics of the bug report.\n\nThere are workarounds however. Really hope Georg Nachman doesn't mind that I share this here, but here's what he does\n\n> Prior to fork()ing, I copy the contents of the environment into a dictionary (this removes duplicates). Then I convert it back into a char**. After fork, I set environ=newEnviron and then do execvp().\n\nThis is how they fixed the issue in RStudio: https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio/commit/09c9be12b12cf030051d5da2b0820df6cb7e7c49\n"
