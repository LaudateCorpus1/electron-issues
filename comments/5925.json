    "body": "I've narrowed this down a bitâ€”it appears that just closing a window can cause this segfault, and that moving back to Electron `1.1.3` resolves the issue for us. I've been able to reproduce this by launching our Electron app and immediately issuing Cmd-Q before the window has even finished requiring modules. It quits at the earliest opportunity, and crashes roughly 25% of the time.\n"
