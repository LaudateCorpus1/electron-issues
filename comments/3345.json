    "body": "Thank you for the quick response!\n\nI'm not sure if it is a platform-specific thing. Is the code you are referencing to Linux-specific or cross-platform? It looks like there are multiple functions to open the devtools...is the version you found definitely what is called by the menu bar shortcut for Chrome or just an API?\n\nThis is what I see on Chrome (\"Developer Tools\"):\n\n![chrome](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/756520/10988263/aee73eee-83ef-11e5-9cd9-c455d6bf73af.png)\n\nIn Chrome, when I press the shortcut once, it brings up the dev tools, if I press it again, it brings up the dev tools on the dev tools (turtles all the way down!). It uses the currently opened tab / window for choosing what to launch in the dev tools. If it is in the background, it comes to the foreground.\n\n---\n\nThis is what I see on Electron (\"Toggle Developer Tools\"):\n\n![electron](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/756520/10988264/aee79d08-83ef-11e5-8be6-eb0e2cf8e0e0.png)\n\nIn Electron, when I press the shortcut once, it brings up the dev tools, if I press it again, it brings closes the dev tools window and I lose all of my debugging information. If it is in the background, it doesn't bring the window to the foreground and closes it regardless of if it is on top or hidden away.\n\n---\n\nThat's why the Chrome version (I'm using) is better since if I can't see the devtools, they appear in the foreground without me having to check if they are already open or not. This is to me a much better solution than me pressing the shortcut, finding out that the window was behind Electron and I just lost my debugging information!\n\nI've been looking through the source code, but it's my first time to look at this. We need to chase the menu option constant (MENU_ACTION_DEV_TOOLS): https://code.google.com/p/chromium/codesearch#chromium/src/chrome/browser/ui/toolbar/app_menu_model.h&l=56 to see what is called...\n"
