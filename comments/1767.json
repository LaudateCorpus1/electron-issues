    "body": "Thanks, that did point me in the right direction. \n\nThere is certainly some weirdness with Flash installs under Windows (8.1 in my case). Here are my findings, in case it helps anyone:\n- Chrome pepper flash plugin is in: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\\XX.XX.XX.XX\\PepperFlash\\pepflashplayer.dll.\n- Chrome Canary plugins are in: C:\\Users\\XXX\\AppData\\Local\\Google\\Chrome SxS\\Application\\XX.XX.XX.XX\\PepperFlash\\pepflashplayer.dll.\n- These are both 32-bit. To get the 64-bit version of Chrome, you need to specify \"another platform\" from the Chrome install page.\n\nWhen you manually install Flash:\n- 32-bit plugins are installed in C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\Macromed\\Flash (notice the helpful 64 in the folder name).\n- 64-bit plugins are installed in C:\\Windows\\System32\\Macromed\\Flash (notice the helpful 32 in the folder name).\n- Both Chrome and Canary will continue to use their own pepflash.dll versions and ignore these.\n"

I was convinced it has to be something else, since my DEBUG was always working with the provided .dll, but i would always see 'plugin couldn't be loaded' whenever i ran release. \n\nIt was just the architecture. Copy&Pasting the other (32bit) .dll fixed everything. \n\nFor being stubborn i had to research this for 16hours, and wanted to safe someone else the troubles.\n"
