    "body": "> that's why I allow myself to mention it here.\n\nI'm sure that's ok in any case.\n\nI wish atom-shell could catch up in this area.  My browser (atom editor\nweb-browser package) is meant as an adjunct to the Atom programming editor,\nnot as a stand-alone browser. I think it manages to serve this reduced\nrequirement already but I'm driven to make it do as much as it can.\n\nThese node-based desktop apps are exciting stuff.  Who'd think there would\nstill be anything interesting to do on the desktop.  Wasn't the web\nsupposed to replace all this stuff?

Probably need to disable node integration on the browser window.\n\nSee browser window options:\n\nhttps://github.com/atom/atom-shell/blob/master/docs/api/browser-window.md#new-browserwindowoptions\n"
