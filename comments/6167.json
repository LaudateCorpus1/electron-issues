    "body": "I don't understand your response.\n\nMy ASARs are structured like default apps. I purposely want multiple ASARs. So while we have a default app.asar that is the main program we wish to have multiple completely isolated programs. Ones we can launch using the same Electron build from our default app. (We don't care about starting up `resources/another_app.asar` as the default app.)\n\nSo what I am asking is shouldn't passing `resources/another_app.asar` as a command line parameter work if there is already an app.asar in your resources folder? For me this behavior doesn't work. And to me it doesn't make sense it shouldn't.\n"
