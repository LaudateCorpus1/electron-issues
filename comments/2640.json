    "body": "As far as I can tell, there is no `app.hide` method - only `browserWindow.hide`.\n\nAm I missing this somewhere? It doesn't seem to be in the docs, and I get `app.hide is not defined` when attempting to call it. I'm on `v0.31.1`.\n\nReformulating in case I wasn't clear:\n- Open Finder\n- Open my app on top of Finder\n  - At this point, the finder window has lost focus, but the osx menubar still says \"Finder\".\n- Call `myOnlyBrowserWindow.hide()`.\n  - At this point, my application is invisible but _still seems to be in the foreground_ becase:\n    - The underlying finder window hasn't regained focus\n    - It is still responding to keyboard shortcuts - pressing `ctrl+q` will quit my app and return focus to Finder\n\nSo in my original question, I was hoping there was a way for me to hide _my entire `app`_, not just my `browserwindow`.\n"
