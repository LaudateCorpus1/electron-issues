    "body": "Hi @zcbenz,\n\n> For Linux, whether a window should be focused is depended on the desktop environment you use, and for most desktop environments it is common to prevent program from taking the focus without user's behavior.\n\nMy window manager (xfwm) is (by default) configured to respect these requests for focus. And honors them -- which can be seen with basically any other application I use, including Firefox, Pidgin, Sublime Text etc.\n\nIt should be noted that Electron-based apps _try_ to get focused by sending the `_NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW` ClientMessage. For some reason, they get raised but not focused.\n\nBy doing a simple `wmctrl -a`, I am able to focus an Electron-based window easily. So the window manager is 1) configured corectly, 2) focusing windows when they request it. Yet, for some strange reason, any Electron-based app fails to do so.\n\nI would say that it is perfectly reasonable (from a UX point of view) to expect _all_ apps, even those written using Electron, to behave in the same way. Currently, this behavior is present on all apps minus Electron. Looks like a bug to me.\n\nI understand that you are busy adding features, but closing the issue without letting the second party reply to your arguments shows a bit of a STFU attitude.\n"

Hit F8 to show _(fails to focus, even though the window is shown correctly)_\n7.
