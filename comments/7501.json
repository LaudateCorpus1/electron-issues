    "body": "Calling `event.preventDefault()` can cancel the navigation, however we currently don't support it for `<webview>` yet, which is tracked at #1378.\n\nAnd I'm afraid that issues is not going to be fixed in near future because it is a limitation of Chromium. The only workaround is to get the `WebContents` object of `<webview>` in the main process and handle the event there.\n"
