    "body": "It's funny because I've been trying to solve why Chromium disables RequestAnimationFrame when we minimize, but it doesn't when we use WindowsKey+D.  Which is a good thing in my case because my game is multiplayer and I need RAF to be running 24/7.   So using the setMinimizable option fixes that for me, but I hope it stays and doesn't turn into a bug and get's patched later down the road :(\n"

    "body": "Oh, yeah I use Web workers for some game logic too. But, the main issue is the arcade physics is tied to RAF. So if a player joins a game and starts shooting fireballs to attack a mob and then if another player joins and that player is alt-tabbed (window is not active), he won't receive notification of those fireballs being sent on his screen. (The server will send them and Chrome/Electron will get them from the websocket, but his client won't  update the location of those fireballs until he activates his screen again). \n\nI mean, you could maybe tie the physics engine through Web Workers... but I'm not sure if that is a good idea. I could be wrong though lol\n"
