    "body": "@aslauris definitely not. Remote is an IPC, and using something such as lokijs through IPC defeats it's purpose and makes it a few times slower.\n\nPlease consider fixing the issue itself, which is most likely related to lokijs being confused by the presence of `window` global. You'll probably find it at window.lokijs (or whatever it's in-browser use case is), instead of it being returned from require.\n"
