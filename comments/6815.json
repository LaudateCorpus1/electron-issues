    "body": "If you are inside the app, why do you need to launch the app through a global protocal handler?\n\nWhy not use IPC to pass new parameters to the main process?\n\nRegardless, that won't **relaunch** the app, that would simply fire the **open-url** event.  If you want to relaunch it you need to update Electron versions and change your listener to be.\n\n``` js\napp.on('open-url', (event, url) => {\n  app.relaunch({\n    args: url,\n  });\n});\n```\n\nFWIW as well, questions like this should really go on Slack or the discussion forums.  The github issues section is for bugs\n"
