    "body": "There is no problem with the image converter taking a path string  value, it is most likely caused by image being unable to decode by the converter. The reason it succeeded with using nativeimage directly because , the converter will just obtain a handle to the native class and the image representation will be empty for corrupt image, wont throw any conversion type error for it. Would be helpful to debug if you could provide the image you were trying to set, couldn't find on the repo you linked. Thanks! \n"
