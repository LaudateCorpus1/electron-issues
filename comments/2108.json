    "body": "@Ivshti my proposal is that the `process.cwd()` should get set to the path of the application. I understand that you can spawn processes anywhere, but I am wondering what the intent of the current implementation was (if any). The fact that it's set to `/` doesn't necessarily mean it's \"by design\", especially if it isn't documented.\n\nEven if process.cwd() isn't the correct API for this, there is still no way that I can see to get the path to the path to the application source folder, e.g. it will be one of these three https://github.com/atom/electron/blob/2bcf8c7bc20d7de6edd6e512044862e70c1e47e7/atom/browser/lib/init.coffee#L58-L65 and `process.resourcesPath` does not point there.\n"
