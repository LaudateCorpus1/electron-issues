    "body": "We would like to have this fixed, but this problem is essentially a bug of Chromium's GPU acceleration, and we are not able to fix it on Electron's side, so I'm closing this as won't fix. I suggest reporting this to Chromium's issues list instead, the Chromium developers would have a much better idea of this issue.\n"
