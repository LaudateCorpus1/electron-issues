    "body": "I believe I have found the cause for this problem, which was a mistake on my part. I passed an incorrect argument for the browser window optional parameter, and because it was not a browser window, it was interpreted as options. (The second parameter, which was the options, must have been taken as the optional callback parameter.)\n\nCould there be some additional error checking on the argument list? This is an easy mistake to make in Javascript with no static type checking.\n\nAfter fixing that problem, I observe one more issue:\n\nIf the default path names a package (a directory tagged in FinderInfo to be displayed as a file), it is interpreted as a directory, which means that the directory is displayed in the combo box and the file name field is initialized with Untitled. This is not the correct behavior, as one can observe in TextEdit with an rtfd format document.\n\n> On Aug 1, 2016, at 5:48 PM, Cheng Zhao notifications@github.com wrote:\n> \n> Closed #6306 https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/6306.\n> \n> â€”\n> You are receiving this because you authored the thread.\n> Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/6306#event-741754173, or mute the thread https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AGUkmfZq6eG4MedSQrps7IU-ciUAJjzvks5qbpPPgaJpZM4JCf16.\n"
