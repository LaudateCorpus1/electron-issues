    "body": "The IPC in Electron copies data cross processes, so you shouldn't assume it is efficient when passing large real-time data.\n\nFor video related things, the only thing you can use is HTML5 video APIs, the low-level ffmepg routines are not exposed in Electron. If you want to do something really complicated, you should probably write a PPAPI plugin instead.\n"
