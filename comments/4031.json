    "body": "This is actually a bug of Chrome, it is not impossible to reproduce in normal browser window since the focus will be switched to address bar, but you can reproduce it in Chrome app.\n\nSteps:\n- Download the hello-world app: https://gist.github.com/zcbenz/d041c65526156cb339cf\n- Load it in Chrome\n- You can see the exact problem in the Chrome app\n\nI'm closing this since there is nothing we can do in Electron, it is most likely a bug in blink, but we don't have the resources of fixing the bug and pushing it to upstream. I suggest reporting it to [Chromium's issues list](https://crbug.com), but it is very likely to be low-priorly.\n"
