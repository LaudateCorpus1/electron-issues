    "body": "In development the version returned by `app.getVersion()` depends on how you launched your app. If you launched it with `electron path/to/app/package_dir` the version will match the one in your `package.json`, however, if you launched your app with `electron path/to/main.js` then you'll get the Electron version. This is because in the latter case Electron will actually read the `package.json` of the default app, which doesn't specify a version, so it will default to the Electron version. Once you package your app the version will always be read from your `package.json`. \n"

Nice to know that.\n\nActually these 3 ways return different values.\n\nWill leave it here for the record.\n\nInside project folder:\n\n1.\n\n`./node_modules/.bin/electron .`\n\nReturns version set in development package.json \n\n2.\n\n`./node_modules/.bin/electron ./app/`\n\nReturns correct version set in app's package.json \n\n3.\n\n`./node_modules/.bin/electron ./app/index.js`\n\nReturns electron version (1.3.3 in my case)\n"
