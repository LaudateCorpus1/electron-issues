The only documentation for this I could find was in the [OS X 10.11 AppKit Release Notes](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/releasenotes/AppKit/RN-AppKit/) - look under the \"Full Screen Menu Item\" section. From this mention, it seems like the code to remove the menu item would be to add the following to the Electron App Delegate:\n\n``` objectivec\n- (void)applicationWillFinishLaunching:(nonnull NSNotification *)notification {\n    [[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] setBool:NO forKey:@\"NSFullScreenMenuItemEverywhere\"];\n}\n```\n\nHope this helps!\n"
