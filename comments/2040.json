    "body": "Well, we can agree to disagree. I build these touchscreen kiosk applications in many retail scenarios, and in almost every case, customers (and often kids) tap around on touchscreens looking for ways to mess up the application or in rare occasions, hack it somehow. So we typically do not afford away to quit a kiosk anywhere in the interface itself. Keyboards, mice and other input devices are not available to the customers in the touchscreen scenarios, only to us as the developers. So we quit the applications when necessary by force-quit via the keyboard, or in remote access/screen sharing.\n\nAt any rate, I found the workaround for me was to simply use fullscreen: true instead of kiosk: true, and that is fine for my purposes. Thanks for your response.\n"
