    "body": "It would be interesting to make this default behavior. I don't think we could use it out of the box in N1 because certain actions, like opening additional windows, cause the app to \"pop\" out of fullscreen or span multiple spaces. (So your application code needs to be aware that it's in fullscreen mode.) Seems like it would likely work for the majority of Electron apps, though.\n"

    "body": "There are a number of things that Electron doesn't do for application authors that are considered \"standard practice\" for some types of applications on some platforms. For reference, see [all the comments in the sample code in the Quick Start guide](http://electron.atom.io/docs/tutorial/quick-start/#write-your-first-electron-app). Because we can't know ahead of time what type of application people have in mind, we don't feel it is appropriate to make those decisions on behalf of application authors.\n\nAdditionally, it is common for application frameworks to not do this on behalf of application authors. Even OS X applications have to [do this for themselves](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/WinPanel/Tasks/SavingWindowPosition.html), it doesn't happen by default.\n\nAs such, as was [stated previously](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/526), we have no API for this and no plans to create one.\n\nThanks very much for your feedback and interest in Electron!\n"
