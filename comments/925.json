    "body": "Apart from `Renderer process started`, there are also other logs would be printed from Chromium, for example a recent bug in Chrome39 would print `Destroying nonempty message queue` when a we page is destroyed.\n\nIt would take too much effort to remove all of them, and sometimes there will be really useful information printed, so I think we should just keep them.\n"
