    "body": "I need plugin (either np API or papper API) support to interact with various user's input like finger scanner, rfid or barcode device. If npapi not supported since it has lots security hole (unrestricted user's permission), would you consider to include papper support. Plugin support make my/ everyone jobs a lot easy to finish and more productive.\n\nFor whiles, I think I have to make node binding module (c++) or using ffi (foreign function interface) to over come that limit, and access the modules via `require('remote').getCurrentWindow()` on the render side.\n\nBut many-many great thank to @zcbenz , your work awesome! :+1: \n"
