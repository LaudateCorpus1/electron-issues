    "body": "@kevinsawicki It is a somewhat tangential issue, but my opinion is that other changes are desired before this is closed.  Specifically, #9474.\r\n\r\nThe WebAssembly piece is functional.  You can test yourself with the [tank demo](https://github.com/vossad01/electron-webassembly-tank-demo), However, because of #9474, the [other demo originally presented](https://github.com/vossad01/electron-webassembly-hello) does not work unmodified.  A user wishing to use WebAssembly must work around the issue; by either modifying the generated bootstrap code to use XMLHttpRequest, or by changing scheme privileged with electron.  Since that utilizes the default bootstrap generated by emscripten, this issue is likely to be encountered by users.\r\n\r\nI don't know if anyone would take it up, but I suppose there could also be the question of whether any tests should be added demonstrating WebAssembly works so it  would be less likely to break on a future update."
