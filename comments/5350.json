    "body": "@zcbenz After some digging, it looks like we might be able to resolve this:\n\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Security/Conceptual/AppSandboxDesignGuide/AppSandboxInDepth/AppSandboxInDepth.html\n\n> Normally, sandboxed apps cannot use Mach IPC, POSIX semaphores and shared memory, or UNIX domain sockets (usefully). However, by specifying an entitlement that requests membership in an application group, an app can use these technologies to communicate with other members of that application **group.**\n> \n> Mach port names must begin with the application group identifier, followed by a period (.), followed by a name of your choosing.\n\nSo it looks like the best way to fix this is to make the Mach channel lookup the channel prefix from Info.plist. The good news is that it pretty clearly states that we _can_ use Mach ports, so if anyone gets rejected from the store for it we've got a pretty good leg to stand on for complaining about it / getting the rules changed\n"

    "body": "@paul @zcbenz Good news guys. I really appreciate all the effort on this issue. I submitted my app yesterday afternoon and today it was approved by Apple. We made it! :)\n\nI do have a question. Before, my app was around 100 MB. Now, the package is 413 MB. Installed, it boats to 1G! The app is 1G! that's huge. My app is 1 small file that loads a website. So the size does not come from my app. \n\nAny thoughts on this. \n\nBut - thanks again for solving MAS! \n"

    "body": "Here is what I discovered. Through lots of testing I ended up building quite a number of builds. I am on a Mac, and generating builds for Windows, Mac and Linux I had a number of directories and builds. When I  would package, it would generate the app.asar and the size would be huge. 350MB huge (normally its <1 MB). When I deleted the other directories with the other builds, the size would slowly go down. It seems the 'unrelated' builds were directly relating the next build. Strange. After I deleted all my previous apps, my app went down to the expected ~112 app size. Packaged, it is 40 (as expected). This seems like a strange bug. \n\nThanks @paulcbetts \n"
