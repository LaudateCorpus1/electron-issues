    "body": "@enlight If I put a webview in a browser window, won't the webview be in its own renderer process as well as the window? So, you're saying it'll send the message to the \"outer\" renderer process, is that right? If I do `ipcRenderer.on(\"ping\", ...)` in the index.js of that window as well as a `webview.addEventListener(\"ipc-message\", ...)`, and then from the preload script do `ipcRenderer.sendToHost(\"ping\")`, it seems that the listener attached to \"ping\" with `ipcRenderer.on` does not catch the message, only the listener attached to the `webview` catches it. Do you know how I can get the `ipcRenderer.on` to catch it?"
