    "body": "This definitely seems useful but looking at the implementation, it looks like something that could be done in a native node module since it isn't using any Electron or Chromium APIs.\r\n\r\nPutting it in a native node module would allow it to be independently versioned, published, and tested, and also work in other contexts like standalone node and nw.js.\r\n\r\nIt also looks like there may already be a module for this, https://github.com/sindresorhus/is-elevated, not sure if it provides the exact same checks but worth looking into.\r\n\r\n@arkon how does this sound to you?"
