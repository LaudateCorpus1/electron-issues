    "body": "Hey there,\n\nQuestions and support request should go on the discussion forums or in slack.  Github is for issues only.\n\nThere are a lot of things _wrong_ with your code, I've fixed a few of them below and tried to explain.\n\n``` js\n// Electron modules are properties of the top level Electron module\nvar app = require('electron').app;\nvar BrowserWindow = require('electron').BrowserWindow;\n\n// Null --> null (lowercase)\nvar mainWindow = null;\napp.on('ready', function(){\nvar mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({\nwidth:800, height: 600\n})\n\nmainWindow.loadUrl('file://Users/m/electron-apps-ex/index.html')\n```\n\nIt might be a good idea for you to check out https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start for a good place to start\n"

(request that such a caveat be added to that list of videos)\n\nYes, it works!  Electron rocks!\nThanks a lot for the quick response.\n"
