    "body": "The two issues are related, for sure, but not quite the same which is why I elected to make this one. The wording in #6031 is unfortunate. Really, when working with chromium, you want to do two things: build locally with PDBs available for debugging (and in the only practical way, which is to use shared libraries), and build a DEBUG version of chromium to get an extra boost of debugging power.\n\nI don't think that --build_libchromiumcontent should be reserved for Linux...that seems unnecessarily narrow.\n\nAnd yes, the Python script hard-codes the static library version, but it is trivial to change to \"shared_library\" or, ideally, pass on the command line. Further, I would argue that when you want to build chromium locally, would it not be in a debugging context when you want shared libraries for efficient electron linking?\n"
