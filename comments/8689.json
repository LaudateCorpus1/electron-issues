    "body": "@groundwater sorry it turns out my electron updated to 1.6.0 according to `npm list | grep electron`. I tested with 1.4.15 and it's the same. \r\n\r\nI don't think it's regression. I think everything works fine for Tray created with context menu (`Menu`). However my Tray is quite custom since it display a BrowserWindow below menubar icon (just like Dropbox for macOS).\r\n\r\nI looked through some samples of creating popovers on macOS and it seems that once popover is displayed a global click listener is assigned and used to track clicks outside of popover to dismiss it and potentially remove highlight from menubar icon when user clicks somewhere else on screen.\r\n\r\nIt feels like it would be great to have some event for this since there is a growing number of menubar apps that are currently being built using BrowserWindows positioned below menu item.\r\n\r\nIn swift it looks as such:\r\n\r\n```swift\r\nself.monitor = NSEvent.addGlobalMonitorForEvents(matching: .leftMouseDown, handler: {\r\n    statusButton.highlight(false)\r\n    NSEvent.removeMonitor(self.monitor)\r\n})\r\n```"

Here's what we came up with: For now, let's add a note to Electron's [Tray](https://electron.atom.io/docs/api/tray/) docs describing this scenario and link to your [NSEventMonitor](https://github.com/pronebird/NSEventMonitor) module as a workaround for those who need it.\r\n\r\nThinking more long term, @kevinsawicki suggested that it would be nice if Electron had a general-purpose way to expose `NSEvent`s. We're not going to prioritize making this happen right now, but if you're interested in working on a PR that explores how such an API might look, we'd be happy to help make it happen."
