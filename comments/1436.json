    "body": "@steelbrain, I think the motivation for having web workers in node is well articulated here: http://blog.std.in/2010/07/08/nodejs-webworker-design/\n\nI thought it would be easy to take advantage of the webworker functionality already built into forge.\n\nBased on the aforementioned thread that explains that this would not be a thread safe configuration, I will not pursue this course any further.  I can add that we did encounter some segmentation faults during our testing.\n\nThanks for the recommendations!\n"
