    "body": "AppImage appears to be a growing trend of sorts but I don't think it suits Electron's distribution methodology.  Applications built on Electron should be asked to provide AppImage files (not Electron).  Electron itself is just a couple of pre-built binaries that can be distributed however you want.  (Could be `.deb`, `.rpm` or `AppImage`).\n\nYour example of a `.dmg` explains this quite well I think, we provide a ZIP file of prebuilts for macOS and if an application wants to distribute a DMG then they generate a DMG and put our prebuilts inside.  The same concept should be applied to AppImage, we provide the prebuilts, applications should do whatever they want with them.\n\nIf you want to build `AppImage` files for you Application I believe the `AppImage` repository has a guide on how to do it üëç \n"
