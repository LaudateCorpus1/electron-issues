    "body": "@rojepp This kind of thing is probably a bug / lacking feature in SysInternals implementation of the virtual desktop environment.  I don't think it is up to electron to (not sure they even can) handle a 3rd party application such as this. <-- IMO\n\nJust out of interest though, if you open a chrome browser and move it to the second virtual desktop, what happens when you open a new window, where does it go?\n"
