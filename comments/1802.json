    "body": "Thanks for confirming this. I didn't glean that information out of the [packaging](https://github.com/atom/electron/blob/master/docs/tutorial/application-packaging.md) doco so it might be helpful to others to list this and any further limitations there.\n\nI used your \"separate directory\" suggestion in the end because the unpack feature will now place the dll in a different folder (`app.asar.unpacked/plugins` instead of `app/plugins`) so I would have to determine if I am in \"asar mode\" or \"directory mode\" and adjust the value passed to `ppapi-flash-path` accordingly.\n\nCan you suggest the best way to determine if the app is being run from an asar file or an actual directory? One thought is to use `originalFs.readFileSync('/path/to/app.asar')` to see if the asar file is there but this is not bullet proof.\n\nI also found an issue with the asar utility which I [reported separately](https://github.com/atom/asar/issues/36).\n"
