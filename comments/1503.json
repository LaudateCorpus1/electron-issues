    "body": "Ah thanks for the test case, @zcbenz in the above scenario the intermediate page loaded from `link.html` doesnt get recorded on [`dying_render_process_`](https://github.com/atom/electron/blob/05ae1960d1e421cf057a960b0526890665983c47/atom/browser/atom_browser_client.cc#L131) so it leads to a werid scenario in `UpdateGuestProcessID`. For example,\n\n| `Page Transition` | `Old Id` | `New Id` |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| index.html load | 6 | 7 |\n| link.html load | 7 | 8 |\n| onclick link | 7 | 9 |\n\nthe solution i can think of is have the `webview_info_map_` as append only [assuming ids are incremental](https://github.com/atom/electron/blob/05ae1960d1e421cf057a960b0526890665983c47/atom/browser/web_view_manager.cc#L47) or find another way to record dying render process. Thoughts ?\n"

If the browser window is already in fullscreen nothing happens when pushing the fullscreen button on the video. If the window is then taken out of fullscreen weird things happen with the video.\n2. If the html contains multiple webview's all of them are included in the fullscreen (see attached image) - toolbar is first webview and video is second webview.\n\nIs it possible to create a completely new window for the video content and assign it a window level above the fullscreen browser window? and also to only include the webview that contains the video?\n\n![screen shot 2015-05-15 at 09 53 20](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/415042/7649132/557591e6-faea-11e4-85bf-7d800c3da3ca.png)\n"
