If you launch it from the command line, it does not.\n\n**Steps:**\n\nGet the vanilla Electron release.\n\nAdd the following code to the end of `default_app.js`:\n\n``` javascript\nvar path = require('path');\nvar cp = require('child_process');\ncp.fork(path.join(__dirname, 'child.js'));\n```\n\nCreate a `child.js` file next to it with the following content:\n\n``` javascript\nvar cp = require('child_process');\n\ntry {\n    console.log('hello from child');\n} catch (err) {\n    cp.exec('start \"New Window\" echo ' + err.message);\n}\n```\n\nSimply double click `Electron.exe`. It will promptly open a command prompt with the following error message: `EBADF: bad file descriptor, write`.\n"
