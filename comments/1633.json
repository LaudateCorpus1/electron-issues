    "body": "I don't know a decent way to get notified when window is moving on OS X or when moving is done on Windows, the only way I can think of is to capture mouse events and determine which event to send according to current dragging state, which I would rather **not** to implement.\n\nSo I think maybe we should just add 2 events, `move` for when window is being moved, and `moved` for when moving is done. And we only implement `move` on Windows and Linux, and `moved` on OS X, in this way we make users aware of the differences between each platform, and leave space for future implementation.\n"

And we only implement move on Windows and Linux, and moved on OS X, in this way we make users aware of the differences between each platform, and leave space for future implementation.\n\nI'm not sure that this is such a good idea, because it effectively just throws the same problem we have onto our users, who will all have to solve it on their own separately. At minimum, we should fire both `move` and `moved` on OS X when the move finishes (and using RxJS or at least the principles behind it, using `move` on Windows to implement `moved` isn't so hard, I'll have a crack at it)\n"
