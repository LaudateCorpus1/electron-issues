    "body": "Cross-compiling on Linux requires installing packages for 32bit target, Electron doesn't download external binaries for building on Linux so it is very likely that you lack some necessary 32bit libraries on your system.\n\nI suggest using chroot for building 32bit target on 64bit machine, it is much more easier to get things right, Chromium has a nice script to install chroot environment:\nhttps://code.google.com/p/chromium/codesearch#chromium/src/build/install-chroot.sh&sq=package:chromium&type=cs&l=7\n"
