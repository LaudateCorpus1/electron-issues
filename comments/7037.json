    "body": "From application side there is not much information we can know on how the application is started. So if the app is launched because user wants to open a file with it, the `open-file` event will be emitted before the `ready` event, otherwise it would be emitted after.\n\nI recommend reading Atom's code on opening file, it shows how to handle `open-file` and `process.argv` at the same time:\nhttps://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/src/main-process/main.js\n"
