Download the Atom repository from github (https://github.com/atom/atom)\n> 2. Open up this file: ~/atom/src/browser/atom-window.coffee\n> 3. At line 26, change this:\n>    \n>    options =\n>      show: false\n>      title: 'Atom'\n>      'web-preferences':\n>        'direct-write': true\n> \n> to this:\n> \n> ```\n> options =\n>   frame: true\n>   transparent: true\n>   title: 'Atom'\n>   'web-preferences':\n>     'direct-write': true\n>     'subpixel-font-scaling': true\n> ```\n> \n> (it could be that you literally just need the 'transparent:true' command here\n> and that those other extras are superfluous, but I haven't recompiled Atom to\n> find out).\n> 1. Compile this version of Atom (this is always a bit trial and error for me. I\n>    suspect most people here know how to do it in their sleep. I navigated to the\n>    atom directory in terminal and ran this: script/build --install-dir ~/<path to\n>    wherever>/Atom.app\n> 2. In Atom, go to Packages > Package Generator > Generate Atom Syntax Theme and\n>    name a new theme\n> 3. Go to Preferences > Themes. Find your theme, select it, and then choose\n>    'view code'\n> 4. This should open a branch of all the files for the new syntax you've\n>    created. Find your base.less style sheet and tailor it to suit your needs. More\n>    info on theme customisation here (https://atom.io/docs/v1.2.0/)\n> \n> I kept it super simple just using these lines which just turn the alpha channel\n> of the background right now.\n> \n> html, body, atom-workspace, atom-pane-container atom-pane {\n>   background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0) !important;\n>   }\n> \n> atom-text-editor, :host {\n>   background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\n>   color: @syntax-text-color;\n> \n> You can quickly check changes (on a mac anyways) by saving the file and hitting\n> ctrl-alt-cmd-l to reload Atom.\n> \n> If this works for you, it's also worth having a 2nd version of Atom handy which\n> doesn't have transparency enabled, cos it can get annoying if you're not in\n> performance mode and just wanna do some coding.\n> \n> For the record, this was the original post that got me started\n> (https://www.reddit.com/r/Atom/comments/33u7ec/transparent_window_test/)\n> \n> It's working pretty well for me. Means I can run an OSC-receiving app I've made\n> in Unity behind the code. Hopefully in the future will contribute a unity\n> package. Right now it's a bit too scrappy/customised to very specific needs.\n> Ought to make it a bit more open-ended/flexible before it's worth sharing.> \n"
