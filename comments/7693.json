    "body": "`electron-rebuild` probably rebuilt the module for the wrong Electron version, this can happen if you install `electron` globally instead of locally. Either remove the global installation of Electron and reinstall it locally, or specify the target version when running `electron-rebuild`. \n\nIf the issue persists I suggest seeking help from the [community](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/README.md#community) since this is not an issue with Electron itself.\n"
