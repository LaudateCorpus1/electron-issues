I've only tested this on OSX 10.11.  With devtools open, when the issue is present, if you hover the edge of the BrowserWindow so that the re-size pointer appears, click and drag in the un-resizable direction, then you can actually drag the window.  For example, to drag horizontally, get the resize pointer on the top edge of the window and drag left or right.  After the initial drag it's possible to move the window in any direction.  The same applies to the right or left edge dragging up or down.  I've attached a little screen recording of this behaviour.\n"
