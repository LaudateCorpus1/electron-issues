    "body": "It sounds good to me.\n\n> My biggest question would be whether ResourceTypeToString should be moved out of atom_network_delegate.cc so itâ€™s more easily accessible to WebContents (and is there a good place to put it?) or if it should just be publicly exposed in atom_network_delegate.h.\n\nI'm good with either solution, probably just expose it in `atom_network_delegate.h` since `atom_api_web_contents.h` is quite bloated.\n"
