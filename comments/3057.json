    "body": "As far as I know that is equivalent to window.devicePixelRatio in browsers. It's either 1 (older screens), 2-3 (retina type screens).\n\nIt does not contain physical unit size info. Concretely a 13\" and 15\" MacBook Pro would return the same scaleFactor but they have a different amount of pixels per square inch.\n\n**NOTE:** I changed the DPI in the title to PPI which is more correct (See [DPI vs PPI](https://99designs.com/designer-blog/2013/02/26/ppi-vs-dpi-whats-the-difference/))\n\nMy use case is for displaying things on the screen that are the same size as in reality. For example you could render a quarter on the screen and hold one up to the screen and it would match in size no matter what the computer screen if I had the correct info. Having this information in general is going to lead to some very interesting responsive design possibilities like: choosing text rendering attributes based on legibility that factors in this extra information, or being able to compare your hand size to a basketball players, or buy shoes and see how things look at real world sizes in front of you. \n"
