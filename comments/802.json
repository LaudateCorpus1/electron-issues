I did not mess with the windows theme so I suspect as you say it may have something to do with the window compositor being turned on.\n"

I'm hesitant to split off an issue, because I feel like there's a single root problem with different consequences.  The root problem seems to be: we're running a modal dialog on the main browser process thread, which is responsible for multiple windows and normally runs the Node/libuv event loop.\n\nFWIW, I have another test case that uses the synchronous version of the open dialog on Xubuntu 14.04 to demonstrate both non-repainting and an \"X Window System error\" that crashes the program.\n"

    "body": "Okay after further tests on two systems one running Windows 8.1 and the other is a Win2k8 VM. I get inconsistent results. I definitely was able to reproduce what you said but now I'm not able to. The dialog boxes on multiple windows do affect each other but what happens for me almost all of the time is that one dialog on one window will hang the other but the files load properly in the respective window almost all of the time. Since I last posted an hour ago I was not able to get a file to load in the wrong window using the steps.\n\nI cannot comment on the threading issues so I've been looking at file_dialog_win.cc and trying various things and Googling and none of which have completely resolved the issue. I'd like to see what @zcbenz has to say about this particular issue.\n"

Input to the earlier ones is blocked until later ones are closed.\n- With the desktop compositor off[*], opening a dialog by clicking the \"Test\" link prevented window repainting on both windows.  Opening a dialog by clicking the menu \"File -> Open\" menu didn't have this repainting problem.\n- It's possible to crash the program, either with or without display compositing.\n  1. Click the \"Test\" link in one window.\n  2. Click the \"File\" menu in one window.  Click the \"File\" menu in the other window.  Alternate back and forth between 3 and 20 times or so.  (I'm not sure exactly what triggers the crash, but clicking on things is enough to do it.)  The program crashes:\n\ncrash output:\n\n```\nThe program 'atom' received an X Window System error.\nThis probably reflects a bug in the program.\nThe error was 'BadWindow (invalid Window parameter)'.\n  (Details: serial 113281 error_code 3 request_code 3 minor_code 0)\n...\n```\n\n[*] uncheck \"Settings -> Window Manager Tweaks -> Compositor -> Enable display compositing\"\n\nI'm personally much less concerned about these problems, because they're easy to avoid -- never use the synchronous version of the show{Open,Save}Dialog functions.  However, if they don't work, then they shouldn't really exist.\n"
