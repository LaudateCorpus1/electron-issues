In my comment today I was just using the electron.exe as it comes from the GitHub releases page without shortcut and I just pinned it to the taskbar. However, in another scenario I was testing with VSCode where we indeed have a proper shortcut generated. I was hoping that the task bar pinning would not produce 2 entries if I programmatically set the ID to be the same as whatever the shortcut is using. But I could not find an ID to make it work....\n"

    "body": "k, went through the exercise of setting up a VM with the Windows 10 Insider Preview build 10565, downloaded electron-v0.34.1-win32-x64.zip, extracted it and ran Electron, then pinned it: no duplicate icon!\n\nTo make sure I did the same procedure on my own machine running the currently released version of Windows 10: there I get duplicate icons.\n\nSo, pretty save to say this duplicate icon business is a Windows 10 bug and should be solved in the next Windows 10 update, which is expected to be released to the general public somewhere next month (nov '15).\n\nSo no need to reopen this case\n"
