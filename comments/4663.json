It doesn't seem to work on KDE + ArchLinux.\n\n```\n    globalShortcut.register('PrintScreen', () => {\n      console.log('Say cheese!');\n    });\n```\n\nThis doesn't work for example, but other keyboard shortcuts register fine. Is there a problem between the chair and the keyboard or is the issue still here?\n\nThanks,\nDan\n"

That's a combination of 3 different keycodes.  You can listen for that accelerator by listening for `Command+Shift+3`.  It wouldn't make sense for that to be considered \"PrintScreen\" as \"PrintScreen\" is actually it's own physical key.\n"
