    "body": "Another problem with transparent window is that you can not click through the transparent areas in the window, because the web page's underlying view still covers the whole window. One solution is to calculate whether the point is transparent when user clicks on the page, and then decide whether to ignore the mouse event, but this solution is quite expensive and needs some more patches in Chromium.\n\nIn Chromium they also have support for [transparent background](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=260810) in web pages (but without support on Mac), and they also have the same problem with us. What they did to solve it is to [provide a API](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=196651) to specify the shape of window, so instead of calculating which area can be clicked through, they just let the users decide. I think we should take this approach too.\n"
