    "body": "I started hacking together a native node addon to do this here: https://github.com/ccnokes/electron-named-image/tree/master\r\n\r\nThe main issue with it currently is that icons (like the up chevron) are black by default, so somehow I need to be able to change the color on them to white (otherwise they're hard to see in the touch bar). NSTouchBar seems to do this automatically when passed a NSImage, AFAIK. \r\n"
