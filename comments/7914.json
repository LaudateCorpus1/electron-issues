    "body": "Thanks for picking this up.\n\n> I'm not clear exactly when CT checking happens though (before or after the CertVerifier::Verify call?) and perhaps there should still be a way of bypassing it?\n\nIt will happen after the verify call, you can look at this state machine https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/net/socket/ssl_client_socket_impl.cc?sq=package:chromium&l=1312.\n\n> I thought about maybe changing the interpretation of the callback value to:\n> - true - resets the verify_result, bypass CT and send back OK result\n> - false - send back ERR_FAILED result regardless of default cert verifier's result\n> - null - send back whatever result the default cert verifier sent and let CT checking happen normally; this assumes that CT checking happens afterwards\n\nThis looks good, but instead of null we can just expect a second boolean argument whether to default to chromium verification result. This argument will be false by default to maintain backwards compatibility.\n\nI have some style changes to this PR locally, will push them today.\n"
