    "body": "@marcelfalliere `electron.asar` is internal Electron logic / JS, none of your files should go in there.\r\n\r\nThe reason your search path is looking there is because `./` is relative to the CWD, in this case a path inside `electron.asar`.  You need to use `__dirname` to locate the actual path of the current file.\r\n\r\nUsing `webpack` with Electron has many problems, a few of which can be solved by setting `electron` as the target for webpack.  Worth noting that IMO `webpack` is designed to solve problems that aren't present in Electron so the pairing doesn't make complete sense."

    "body": "@MarshallOfSound `webpack` in conjuction with `vue.js` framework is really useful, for me at least, in (a) the development process : I get sweat Hot Module Replacement and ES6/7 and (b) in the long run, a big app with both components-oriented and flux-style architecture is the best IMHO. I started with `nw.js` and `vanillajs` but oh boy. Anyway, maybe that is another debate. I've used [this bootstrap](https://github.com/SimulatedGREG/electron-vue) by the way (what do you think?).\r\n\r\nOk I will test with `__dirname` but I'll have to double check that it works when building the electron app.\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nSo in dev, it seems to work 👍 \r\n\r\nWhen building it does not ! The devtools targeted at the webview says : `Cannot find module '<absolutePathToApp>/MyApp.app/Contents/Resources/app.asar/dist/libs/webviewInjectedScript.js'`\r\nExtracting the `app.asar`... there is a `dist` folder, but inside no `webviewInjectedScript.js`. Webpack builds one file for each process. My file should be somewhere in the `main.js` built file ... but oh boy. This can be fixed by a switch in the source code, testing if we are in production or development env. Maybe this needs simply an execption : do not build the `webviewInjectedScript.js` file inside a `main.js` file, so I can require it no problem ?... A headache I'm telling tou 😀 \r\n\r\nEdit (the next day) : thanks to [copy-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/kevlened/copy-webpack-plugin) it was easy to simply copy the file \"as-is\".\r\n\r\nI have another problem now (in dev), but that's for another issue. But In short :\r\n- the renderer process make an IPC call\r\n- the main process catches it\r\n- still in the main, it call an IPC that is destined to the webview (using [this technique](http://ourcodeworld.com/articles/read/201/how-to-send-retrieve-information-and-manipulate-the-dom-from-a-webview-with-electron-framework))\r\n- but nothing is received in the preload script.!\r\n\r\nThanks !\r\n\r\n"
