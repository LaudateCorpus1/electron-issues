    "body": "Looking at those issues it would seem like this is not related just to a specific platform: given that the Slack team is observing similar issues too, I'd agree that this could be related to a Chromium :bug:.\n\nSo, based on @paulcbetts's investigation, there are a couple of things we should probably do to fix this:\n1. Make sure we're running the latest Squirrel version. It seems like AppCompat was messing with DPI stuff and this has been fixed in the last versions (https://github.com/Squirrel/Squirrel.Windows/pull/478)\n2. Upgrade Electron's Chromium Version. It seems like the Chromium team is aware of this problem and they've been discussing it [over here](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=484400): unfortunately, a fix hasn't landed yet, so I _think_ the only two options here would be to:\n   - Wait for a fix to land on the next Chrome versions;\n   - Or, if that's not going to happen anytime soon, patch libchromiumcontent ourselves;\n\nAs far as I can tell, they're already working on a fix (https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=485650) and the plan is to :shipit: in time for Chrome 49.\n\n@zcbenz: I am going to reopen this issue, but I'd like to hear your thoughts about it :thought_balloon:. From the changelogs it's not clear if some sort of fix has been shipped on Chrome 48, but it's probably worth having a :eyes: at it.\n"
