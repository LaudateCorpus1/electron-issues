    "body": "I am starting to learn electron and I am using samples (https://github.com/hokein/electron-sample-apps) to see how they work. When running the print sample or even my own code the printing always stays at spooling stage and no output is created / printed.  A simple web page even with 2-3 lines just stays in spooling stage and refuses to proceed. \r\n\r\nI have tried to run the app on 4 different PCs running Windows 7 (32 and 64 bit) and Windows 10 (32 and 64 bit) but the prints remain in spooling no matter if they are physical printers or xps and pdf printers.\r\nThe problem manifests only in latest versions of electron. Anything lower than 1.4.12 and prints don't get stuck at spooling stage. The problem only happens after version 1.4.12 till 1.6.13 (beta).\r\n\r\n"
