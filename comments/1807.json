    "body": "@frozeman the stream one is actually quite simple, there are different stream events like `responseDetails` and stuff, so electron's coffee part could just emulate that and notify the c++ side about it, that would be like\n\n``` coffee\nclass protocol.RequestAsyncJob\n  constructor: (@outputStream) ->\n    outputStream.on('responseDetails', @gotResponseDetails)\n    outputStream.on('data', @gotData)\n    outputStream.on('end', @gotEnd)\n\n  gotResponseDetails: (responseDetails) =>\n    console.log(responseDetails) # {statusCode: 401, headers: ['location': 'https://google.com/']} etc\n  gotData: (data) =>\n    console.log(data) # Node Buffer<...>\n    console.log(data.toString()) # \"the data\"\n  gotEnd: =>\n    # Do some magic\n```\n\nAll those events I used above are already emitted by the `request` library and can be easily emitted by a personal one too. and by using this structure, You can check if the user's provided argument is a stream and listen to those methods automatically, otherwise wait for the user to trigger them themselves, IMO that would simplify things a lot.\n"
