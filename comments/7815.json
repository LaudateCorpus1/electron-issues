The pen does not allow me to select type. There is no response to clicking on videos or images (cannot hit play, send image to full screen). Cannot switch between threads or direct messages. Scroll bar doesn't work. I believe the problem was not this bad several months ago. My Wacom usually works fine outside of Slack. On rare occasion it does not switch preferences from one application to the other (occasionally does not switch from Blender pen preferences to Finder preferences).\r\n\r\nCharlie Hess's Oct 2016 post might be around the time Slack began having Wacom interactivity problems."

    "body": "Hey, I got the same problem. I'm building an app with electron and I am using the myScript API for handwriting recognition. There are no problems with Myscript and my wacom Intous on other browsers or chrome itself. There is only a lag when i am using it with electron. Click and writing is possible but you have to rest the pen for maybe 100-500 Milliseconds on the same spot before you start writing. \r\nI am pretty new in electron..\r\n\r\nWell I found out, that there are no problems with the pen input if you set experimentalFeatures true:\r\n`mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({width: 800, height: 600, 'webPreferences': {'experimentalFeatures': true}});`\r\n\r\nBut the I have a way bigger problem. All my onmousedown, onmouseup etc. events are not working anymore! :("
