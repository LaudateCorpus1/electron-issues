    "body": "The design of Node's module system doesn't allow loading the same native module for multiple times in one process, so in atom-shell the renderer process is forced to restart when a page navigation happens or page is reloaded, in this way a page navigation would behave like restarting a Node process.\n\nHowever in webview the renderer process doesn't restart for navigation or reloading, which prevented the native module to load when it has already been loaded in the same process.\n\nIdeally the page in webview should behave the same with the page in BrowserWindow, but Chromium somehow treats it differently, I'm still looking into it.\n"

So even your patch solved the module not loading problem, lots of native modules will still not work after a page navigation.\n\nThe correct solution is to force webview to restart render process on navigation, which behaves in the exact same way with Node/io.js.\n"
