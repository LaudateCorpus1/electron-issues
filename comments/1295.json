    "body": "I think `dns_config_service_posix` does play nicely at log level `0`.\n\nI tried in vain to quiet  `socket_host_udp` though (part of webrtc, it logs many times a second at `VLOG(0)` under some circumstances from [this line](https://gist.github.com/beaugunderson/be3c930f061e2d42bf6b#file-vlog0-txt-L41)). There were a couple of others but they were more intermittent.\n\nThe main problem is that there doesn't seem to be a way to log at less than `0`... So possible bugs could be:\n- option parsing doesn't handle `--v=-1` correctly?\n  - there are unit tests that test for dashes in options, so I think it gets passed through\n  - I looked at the parsing code for StringToInt but gave up\n  - the log levels are actually negative, so I'm not sure how the code deals with a positive value (`-1` would get turned into `1)\n- or, alternately, `VLOG(0)` shouldn't be used for things that log as often as happens in `socket_host_udp`\n\nI just took the pragmatic approach though, I'm happy with this until logging stuff gets fixed upstream if that's what needs to happen:\n\n``` bash\n$ npm install -g silence-chromium\n$ electron index.js 2>&1 | silence-chromium\n```\n"
