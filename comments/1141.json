You would basically interact with the socket in the browser-process and re-send the received events to the corresponding windows. And from the windows you could send msgs to the browser-process (also via ipc), which handles the socket stuff.\n(You could replace browser-process with your main-window for better debuggability (breakpoints, etc) of the socket-stuff.)\n\nConsider changing the title of this issue to something with \"socket.io\".\nI haven't used socket.io with Atom-Shell, so there might be a much better solution than the proposed. It may be worth asking others for their experience with Atom-Shell & socket.io.\n"
