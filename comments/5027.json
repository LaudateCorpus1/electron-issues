Did you run `npm install mqtt`? Is it located in a `node_modules` folder at the root of your Electron app?\n"

    "body": "Hi @kevinsawicki ,thanks for your help.\n    I  download Electron’s release package(electron-v0.37.4-win32-ia32), done writing my app, run as a distribution on my client computer.\n   My understanding is 'electron-v0.37.4-win32-ia32'  don't have 'mqtt' modules,because 'mqtt'   modules is third party modules of node.\n   My solution: npm install mqtt.Then I can see a mqtt folder in node_modules folder and I copy the mqtt folder to my app boot folder.\n   And my code is: var mqtt = require('./mqtt'); By this way I can use 'mqtt' and normally operating at all clients without installing nodejs or install mqtt modules .\n  Is this approach feasible? Is there any better way?\n    Thanks\n"
