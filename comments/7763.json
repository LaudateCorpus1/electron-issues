A cursory google search will reveal a couple of techniques.\n"

    "body": "> Yes, but why not provide a simple API to translate contents in main and render process\n\nIt wouldn't be \"simple\", there are lots of different ways to do translations and lots of different ways people will want them to work.  As mentioned before, IMO just do the same thing you would do if it was a web app.\n\n> Or it not an API, why not explain or give some library in doc ?\n\nWe don't like to play favorites with libraries.  And most people don't use libraries they use some form of JSON file with a custom function or class specific to their use case.\n"
