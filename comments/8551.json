Your `$PATH` variable.\r\n\r\nWhen packaged and launched normally these variables are not inherited so it only uses the default known system path variable.  Your custom version of Ruby must not be on the default path but on a path loaded in your bash environment.  Hence, works in dev, fails when packaged"
