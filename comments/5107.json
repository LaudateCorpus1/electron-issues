    "body": "@eiriarte Thanks for sharing that, however that did not work. If I pack the files for the main process using webpack, even with the node configuration that you have said, I still get the same error. \n\nI am sharing a workaround that I am using to get around the issue for others who land on this thread. \n\nInstead of using es features which require babel to transpile them to work correctly in the main. js file, I separated these out into different files. In my main.js I do not use any features which require babel transpilation. So instead of import I use require. For code which was using es7 proposal features such as async, I moved that code to different files, within a folder called desktopServices (you could come up with a better name). I now run webpack to create a bundle  for desktopServices and I reference this bundle in main.js. \n\n`const myshell = require('./dist/desktopServices').myShell`;\n\nMy webpack.config.main.js file contains the following config. \n\n```\n\nlet config = {\n  target:'electron',\n  entry:'./desktopServices/desktopServices.js',\n  output:{\n    path:path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),\n    filename: 'desktopServices.js',\n    publicPath:'/dist/',\n    libraryTarget:'commonjs2'\n  },\n  resolve: {\n    extensions:[\"\",\".js\",\".json\"]\n  },\n  module: {\n    noParse: /node_modules\\/json-schema\\/lib\\/validate\\.js/,\n    loaders:[{\n      test: /\\.js?$/,\n      exclude: /node_modules/,\n      loader: 'babel-loader'\n    },\n      {\n        test: /\\.json/,\n        loader: 'json-loader',\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n}\n\nmodule.exports = config;\n```\n\nNot the cleanest way, but I guess this is the route I am taking for the time being till some of the es features I want to use get incorporated into node and don't require babel transpilation. \n"
