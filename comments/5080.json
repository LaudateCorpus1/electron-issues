    "body": "@zcbenz , that is very true. I was just hoping to get a little insight on some internal structure that could cause something like this, because even when I strip away all of my external code, the `show` event never fires, while all of the others do. So I know there is a condition where the `show` event can be blocked, so if I am ever able to reproduce the issue, I will come post my findings here.  \n\nThanks. \n"
