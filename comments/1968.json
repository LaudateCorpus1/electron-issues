    "body": "@mmastrac Hi!  I'm afraid this is still broken here on Windows 10 Home, using the same testcase:\n\n``` js\nvar net = require('net')\nvar client = net.createConnection({ path: '\\\\\\\\.\\\\pipe\\\\mypipe', function () { console.log('connected') })\n```\n\nThis works (\"connected\" is printed) when run as a script executed by node v5.1.1, but fails (hangs forever) when executed by Electron v0.36.0, which includes your fix.  Looking at the `client` object shows it's hung in `connecting: true`.\n\nAnything I can do to help debug?\n"
