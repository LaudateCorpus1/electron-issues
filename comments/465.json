There is no sane way to detect this. \n\nEven if Unity isn't being used at all (i.e. Xubuntu based on Xfce, etc), if libnotify is patched, you'll get the dialog box. You can't detect based on distro name either, because lots of distros like Elementary OS are based on Ubuntu and therefore inherit Ubuntu's brain-damaged notifications while not being _called_ \"Ubuntu\". While I'm totally on-board with coming up with a better heuristic (since this one fails too in a number of scenarios), it's Not So Easy to do so. \n"

A better one (not the best, but still) is the one proposed in https://github.com/electron/brightray/pull/197, although it should be fixed as `XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP` has to be handled as a `:`-separated list.\n\nSo, please fix electron.\n\nPS: I'm an Ubuntu unity developer, if you need anything else.
