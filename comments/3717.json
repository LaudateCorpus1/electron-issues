We could try some funny business inside Brightray and download an image, save it to disk, and then serve it - but I don't think that that would be decent solution, given that we'd just moving the work to a lower level. Saving it to disk yourself is the correct solution here.\n\nI'm closing this for now, as it's not a bug, just the current behavior.\n"
