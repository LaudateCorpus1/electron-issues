    "body": "Google Analytics also complains about cookies not enabled, when loading the app from file protocol. This is probably related to the fact that cookies are disabled for file protocol in Chrome by default and can be enabled with the \"enable-file-cookies\" switch.\r\n\r\nLook here:\r\nhttps://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=535\r\n\r\nEDIT: Just to clarify the issue:\r\n\r\nThis happens if we use external libraries that use document.cookie in the renderer process. If we open Facebook in a frame/webview, it will work fine, since http/s protocols have document.cookie enabled. There  is one workaround - to use the electron-cookies npm module, but it uses localStorage. An easy fix would be to add the config switch --enable-file-cookies to the list of supported command-line options."
