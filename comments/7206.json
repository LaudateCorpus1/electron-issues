    "body": "@kevinsawicki I'm currently developing a [time tracker](https://qotoqot.com/qbserve/) that detects how much time users spend in apps, including different Slack teams, so I hit this limitation when Slack moved from accessible Safari-based wrapper to Electron. I found a workaround (by using window names) but there are other accessibility-heavy tools like [Hammerspoon](http://www.hammerspoon.org) and different macOS window managers.\n\nIn case of Chromium-based browsers users can always enable accessibility at `chrome://accessibility/` or other apps can force `AXEnhancedUserInterface` parameter (though it's a problematic approach). So it would be great to have some switch for Electron too.\n\nThank you!\n"

I use workaround already but it will be a great improvement to match native apps.\n\nAny app with accessibility permission can use `extern AXError   AXUIElementSetAttributeValue (AXUIElementRef element, CFStringRef attribute, CFTypeRef value);` and set attribute on any `AXUIElementRef` of another app, including the app itself. As far as I understand, you can declare a custom attribute but I've never tried it.\n\nAllowing Apple's `AXEnhancedUserInterface` without [the check for VoiceOver](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/df0d2b89cdfef63c61d9f8fbea94cbca404379c7/atom/browser/mac/atom_application.mm#L72) would be great too.\n"

For example, if I open slack in Safari, and then give the show numbers command, almost every clickable element has a number bubble that appears on the screen, and I can speak a number to select it.
