I haven't seen anything like that though...\r\n\r\nWe don't have that currently, it is totally a case by case basis. But I think it was great that you opened this issue up here, it is good to have this discussion since this seems like a valuable feature that many apps would want to take advantage of.\r\n\r\nSome APIs can't be done as native node modules because Electron does not provide the objects/hooks needed. Other times Chrome already has great APIs to do things like this and so it is straightforward to add public APIs to Electron that call directly into these Chrome APIs.\r\n\r\nAs a next step, perhaps someone could spike out a node module that registers a service based on https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/SysServices/Articles/providing.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000853-BABDICBI and see if it is possible or if Electron would need to provide something to enable it."
