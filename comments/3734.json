    "body": "Also it would be nice if it were publicly accessible from `webContents` to access the actual `history` array on the `NavigationController` instance. I read through the source and saw the array is never exposed.\n\nI'm currently patching the navigation controller object to do this:\n\n``` coffee\nrequire(\"navigation-controller\").prototype.getHistory = ->\n {history: @history, index: @currentIndex}\n```\n\nAs long as this is added prior to instantiating `new BrowserWindow` it'll get picked up as a function on the prototype here: https://github.com/atom/electron/blob/master/atom/browser/api/lib/web-contents.coffee#L55\n\nNow we can access that object:\n\n``` coffee\nmainWindow.webContents.getHistory()\n```\n"
