    "body": "I installed Google Chrome Version 46.0.2490.71 (64-bit) from Google's YUM repo and then created a small test web page (in a local file called paste_test.html) containing the following HTML:\n\n```\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <body>\n    <textarea rows=\"50\" cols=\"100\"></textarea>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\nI then loaded the page (paste_test.html) using Google Chrome and attempted to paste the content of the \"works\" file (4000 characters) into the textarea element using \"xsel -b < works\" followed by Control+V. This worked as expected.\n\nHowever, when I did the same for the \"no_work\" file (4001 characters) using \"xsel -b < no_work\" followed by Control+V I got what appeared to be the same behavior as the Atom editor i.e. the Google Chrome tab appeared to freeze for several seconds. After this freeze was finished the page seemed to return to normal and nothing had been placed into the textarea control (confirmed by checking the textarea's \"value\" property).\n\nI imagine this confirms it is an issue with Electron versus Atom (assuming it was either/or; I understand this may still be a problem with X11, GTK, etc.)?\n"

Also note that I am using CentOS inside of VirtualBox (version 4.3.28 r100309); I'm not sure if that matters or not. Lastly, Atom doesn't seem to place anything on STDOUT/STDERR when started from the command-line so I got nothing from it for the good or bad (errant) paste operations.\n\nDoes this point to an issue in GTK (as Gdk may be the GIMP Drawing Kit)?\n"
