    "body": "As per my other issue on auto-updating 'asar' files - it's possible a change to how Electron looks for 'apps' could offer both an 'update' solution and/or a more flexible way of handling apps?\n\nRight now I assume it looks for - in order\n\napp\\ directory\napp.asar\ndefault_app\\ directory\n(not sure if it looks for default_app.asar?)\n\nOne useful idea - make it look for app_update\\ or app_update.asar and rename those before running them as app\\ or app.asar - that's a built-in auto-update mechanism\n\nAnother approach is allow us to specific what to look for - e.g. \"electron myapp\" would look for myapp\\ or myapp.asar\n\n??\n"
