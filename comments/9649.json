    "body": "I see the problem. Right now each remote object only has 1 reference per webContents, and #9389 fixed this for multiple windows in the same process(for both `sandbox` and `nativeWindowOpen`), but it's still a problem for iframes(and possibly any other construct that creates multiple contexts in the same `webContents`).\r\n\r\nRight now I can't think of a simple way to fix this, I guess it would involve the main process allowing 1 reference per renderer frame or context, but I don't think we currently have an API that exposes this kind of granularity. @zcbenz do you have some idea on how to fix?"
