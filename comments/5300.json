But it might also makes Electron more \"web designer friendly\"? You can just drag&drop an `index.html` on it and have it shown in a new window. Not too useful and you can do it with a browser too, but it might still give some \"wow, that's easy\" effect?\n\nWe could just reduce it in height to make it a bit less prominent?\n"
