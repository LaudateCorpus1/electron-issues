    "body": "We've also had this problem. Seems that the printer generates bad Destination references for the links, writing just the fragment identifier in a link without creating a reference with that identifier in the dictionary. \n\nWe've managed to go around this limitation by post-processing the PDF with Apache PDFBox in Java, but there are also Python libraries that can help, e.g. [PyPDF2](https://pythonhosted.org/PyPDF2/Destination.html). \n\nThe idea is to iterate through all the annotations, identify the broken ones, and set the correct destinations.\n\nBut yes, we're very much looking forward to that pull request being merged :-D\n"
