    "body": "> Hello, is there any support for native popovers and tooltips ?\r\n\r\nThere isn't explicit support for native popovers and the tooltip support is limited to what Chrome enables via the `title` attribute on an HTML element.\r\n\r\nYou can create, position, and customize the look and feel and behavior of arbitrary windows so you can implement popovers in your app in a way that makes sense depending on which platforms you want to support.\r\n\r\nElectron does have modal window support as well, http://electron.atom.io/docs/all/#modal-windows"
