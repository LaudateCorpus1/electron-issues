    "body": "When I was doing it it was just standard jQuery to grab the element (browser-plugin) or whatever it's name is, can't remember off the top of my head. Then I'd just set it's background color using the css function. In my particular case I set it to black. Maybe it worked, maybe it didn't but now in my app I don't have to do it anymore so that's why I said I may be totally off base by providing this. \n\nIn my app I have the webview's visibility set to hidden, I load it while it's hidden and then I show it once it's ready. I don't see a white flash and I don't need to do any crazy setting of background colors. This is just my experience with webview but I'm sure it's not a valid solution for everyone. \n"
