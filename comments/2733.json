Almost surely there are going to be regressions, so why on earth would a release containing new features and bug fixes be postponed, potentially for days, just to bump to Node.js v4.0.0?\n\nAlong the sentiment by @paulcbetts; calm down... Node.js v4.0.0 hasn't even been out 12 hours yet. \n"

    "body": "I want to claim one thing here: most things you are excited about come from V8, like better performance and new ES6 features. And in Electron we are always using the V8 that shipped with Chromium, instead of the one that shipped by Node.js, so the Electron v0.32.0 is actually io.js v3.3.0 with V8 4.5, which have all the ES6 features you want in Node.js 4.0.0.\n\nThe changes in io.js/Node.js itself may break things sometimes, which you definitely do not want under most cases, so we do not update to the latest one immediately after the release. We usually update io.js/Node.js when: 1) there is a fix we need, 2) there are breaking API changes in V8, 3) the last io.js/Node.js have been stable enough. For the 4.0.0 release, I would like to wait for a few weeks because it is a major version update anyway.\n\nI'm closing this because we have a regular plan of updating to latest io.js/Node.js, and we don't open issue for every update.\n"
