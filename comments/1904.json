You'll go into fullscreen as you'd expect. Click the fullscreen button again and you'll leave fullscreen. Try clicking the fullscreen button again the fullscreen events have stopped propagating. \n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that this worked as expected just a few days ago when I built from master with absolutely no extra code, \"It Just Worked(tm)\" out of the box. This does not work in 0.27.2.\n\nThe main.js and package.json are standard text book, nothing special so I won't post them here.\n\n``` html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n\n  <head>\n    <title>Webview Fullscreen Test</title>\n    <style>\n      body {\n        margin:0;\n        overflow: hidden;\n      }\n      #webview {\n        position:absolute;\n        width: 100%;\n        height: 100%;\n      }\n    </style>\n  </head>\n\n  <body>\n    <webview id=\"webview\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/GxfwZMdSt4w?autoplay=1\"></webview>\n\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\">\n      var remote = require('remote');\n      var browser = remote.getCurrentWindow();\n      //browser.openDevTools();\n\n      var webview = document.getElementById(\"webview\");\n      webview.addEventListener(\"enter-html-full-screen\", function() {\n        browser.setFullScreen(true);\n      });\n      webview.addEventListener(\"leave-html-full-screen\", function() {\n        browser.setFullScreen(false);\n      });\n    </script>\n  </body>\n\n</html>\n```\n"
