    "body": "We do not and will not support building with Xcode, ninja is used because it is fast and has same interface on all platforms. If you want to generate a Xcode project you can start hacking by changing gyp generator to Xcode in [script/update.py](https://github.com/atom/atom-shell/blob/master/script/update.py#L32), but we will not provide support for it and it may require some changes of building configurations to work.\n\nAlso the `Atom Framework.framwork` is not for use in other applications, it has a `main` function and is quite self-contained, so there is just no way to integrate atom-shell into your own application.\n"
