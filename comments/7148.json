    "body": "I think the root problem is we have two `exe` files, and each one should be used under different cases. An alternative way to fix this is to split `electron.exe` into `electron.exe` and `electron.dll`, and use the former as a small wrapper to find and load `electron.dll`, just like what Chrome does.\n\nA discussion on the alternative way can be found at https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/5830#issuecomment-243706205.\n"
