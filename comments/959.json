The `session` object would control the persistence of cookies (default or custom), the storage path for all data related to content module (cache, local storage, etc...) as well as a parameter `off_the_record` which when set to true makes the content module persist nothing.\n\nThis is very close to the content module API. See https://github.com/breach/thrust/blob/master/src/browser/session/thrust_session.h for an example.\n\nLet me know if it looks good to you. Maybe we can skip custom cookie persistence first and work on it later on.\n"

    "body": "I have the same symptom @goddyZhao already had, but a bit different. \nA portion of cooke is not persistent, for example, a login of facebook popup is continuously asking a password with the ID already filled in. I first thought it's facebook's peculiarity but \n\n`loginWindow.webContents.session.cookies.get({domain: \".facebook.com\"}`\nis obviously changing after a login popup, but if I restart app it all returns to the previous state. \n\nI tried to set it up with cache: false with \n`const ses = session.fromPartition('persist:facebook', {cache: false,});`\nand also tried to flush but both all in vain.\n`loginWindow.webContents.session.flushStorageData()`\n\nlooks like cache files are saved under the `~/Library/` though\n\nWhat am I missing ? \n"
