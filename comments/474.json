So my earlier comment that this was not fixed is wrong.  However, I agree with @paulcbetts - Alt-F mapping to 'forward word command' is not the default behaviour that most windows users would expect.   \n\nIt looks like keymaps.cson can contain platform specific sections.   (See for example: https://github.com/diiq/atomatigit/commit/9e8cf0364c574700374ba3dacd65ec55389cd8e3)  I am tempted to create an issue or pull request to remove the Alt+X bindings for Win32 platform.   Please comment if that is not a good idea.\n"

Pressing \"s\", after that, should save my work.\n\nThe way I fixed this problem, with an older version of atom-editor, was to delete the emacs.json file (under â€œresources\\apps\\keymaps\\\").  Now that file is no longer there, and modifying \"keymaps.cson\" seems to only work \"for a little while\", then revert to the \"default\" mapping (1970s terminal style).  \n\nI am guessing that the \"default\" keymap  is still coded in some file I can dispose of ... but where? Alternatively, is there a \"reload keymap file\" command which I could use in place of a restart?\n"

Processing the keymap before the applications hot-keys will enable atom to be a high custom IDE specific to the user.\n\n@rjattrill - Ross, I don't see pull-request #7343, so I'm unable to tell you the approach is correct.\n"

If it is the same across OS X, Linux and Windows then the approach in my pull request might not be correct.\n\nThere is no equivalent to Alt+\\* to open a menu on OS X. The standard way on OS X to reach the application menu is Ctrl+F2, after that you can go to menu entries by entering the first letter of the name of the desired menu entry or by using the cursor keys.\nJust a note on your pull request, if Atom should be localized in the future, ALt+F of course won't work in every other language, so maybe for this kind of 'overrides' it's worth considering a solution which allows localization.\n"
