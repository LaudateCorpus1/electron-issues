There is more information on it in #254.\n\nOne thing you can do is set `nodeIntegration: false` on the browser window (or web view) that is loading these login screens. This enables jQuery to pick the right environment and work as expected.\n\n``` js\nwindow = new BrowserWindow({width: 800, height: 600, nodeIntegration: false});\n```\n\nAnother option would be to preload jQuery.\n\nI'm going to close as a dupe #254.\n"
