    "body": "Our release infrastructure works like this:\n1. I push a version bump commit\n2. CI server runs `build.py` and `upload.py`\n3. I wait an hour for CI servers to finish\n4. I run `upload.py -p` on my machine\n\nI think we can make the checksum generation automatic by:\n1. In `upload.py` upload the checksum files to intermediate place on S3\n2. In `upload.py -p` (which runs the code under `args.publish_release`), download the intermediate checksum files and merge them into a `SHA256SUMS.txt`, and then upload it\n\nDownloading all the files in releases is usually a better idea, and we are already doing it for generating checksums for node headers (see `upload-checksums.py`). But the files of Electron are too large (mainly the symbols), it is not reasonable to download all of them on a local machine.\n"
