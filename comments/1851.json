If it's not solved in chromium, then it's probably something very rare, and IMO remote uses something that induces it. Especially if binding callback functions - this seems to be most crash-inducing thing for me to do. I haven't seen any crashes since I've minimized my remote usage a few days ago, but still it's a very serious issue, so maybe we should put a warning in the IPC page.\n"
