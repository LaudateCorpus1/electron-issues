    "body": "If we are going to implement this in Electron, I think we should implement this with existing APIs of Electron instead of using the native API provided by OS X. This feature has to be implemented across platforms, so having a common implementation will make the maintenance much easier.\n\nThere are also implementation details to consider:\n- What should we do when user sets an initial position and window size;\n- If we allow saving custom states, when should when let users read and write the custom states;\n- How to precisely save and restore minimized/maximized state;\n- How state restoring should work when `show` option is `false` and `true`.\n"
