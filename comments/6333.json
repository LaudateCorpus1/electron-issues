    "body": "> I assume this solution does not prevent the normal HTML DND with dataTransfer to support DND inside the window?\n\nNo, this API just adds the file to current drag data, it doesn't remove existing data. So usually you need to call `event.preventDefault()` to prevent the default DND of DOM.\n\n> when I use this mechanism and drop to another Electron window, will I be able to read the dragged files in the same way I can do it today (e.g. when someone drags a file from the desktop onto the window)?\n\nIt should be exactly the same.\n\n> how would this support DND of multiple files?\n\nI actually added the support, but somehow it doesn't work on Windows. The code path was never ran in Chromium, so I guess this is a bug of Chromium's dragging code.\n\nYou can try with `startDrag({files: ['file1', 'file2']})`.\n"

Our organization created the chromium hack that this feature mostly obviates.\n\nWhat kind of effort is involved in fixing drag-out for multiple files? Unfortunately, I believe I'll personally have a hard time tracking down, filing and/or fixing the bug in Chromium myself.

The Drag & Drop API in browsers support passing a node in the `img` parameter with `event.dataTransfer.setDragImage(img, xOffset, yOffset)`, which is really handy for building custom ghost images.\n\nFor instance, say you're making a presentation app and you want to drag a slide out into Finder/Explorer or another app. Using the node for the slide to represent the drag image would make the most sense. Let's say I'm dragging multiple slides. I would want to add a number counter to my drag image. This could all be done with just a few styled elements.\n\nIf there's already a way to do this that I'm missing, I'd be very interested!\n"
