    "body": "Looks like it comes from [here](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/atom/browser/api/atom_api_menu.cc) (in ExecuteCommand function). I tried things with MicrotasksScope but as a beginner it's quite hard to know how to solve this because I don't know what Base::Callback is doing and why the callback is fired but the js promise is then delayed. At least I had the opportunity to work a bit with v8 and the api. I'll follow to see how this is resolved or help is there are any other clue !\n"
