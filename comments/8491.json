    "body": "EDIT: Realized a wrote a lot so I'll TLDR it\r\n\r\nThis is expected behavior üëç, global shortcuts are inherently, global\r\n\r\n@httpdigest `electron-localhost` in my personal opinion is not a good solution to your issue.  The core thing to understand here is that the `globalShortcut` API is by definition \"global\".  I.e. The shortcut will work from any application \"globally\" on the users machine and it will prevent the normal key events from being used.\r\n\r\nIf you want to listen for shortcuts only when a given window is in focus you have two options.\r\n\r\n* Use `window.addEventListener('keydown', fn)` and handle key events yourself\r\n* Add the action to a MenuItem in your window's menu with an accelerator as the shortcut\r\n\r\nIf you don't want to do manual shortcut parsing there are libraries that will do it for you such as [`mousetrap`](https://npmjs.com/mousetrap).\r\n\r\nTo clarify as to why I don't think `electron-localshortcut` is a good idea in this situation, it's literally adding `globalShortcut` handlers and removing them on `blur` of the window.  This results in some issues.\r\n\r\n1. Other applications can get a lock on the shortcut when you lose focus, i.e. the shortcut will magically stop working when you switch back to the app later\r\n2. Some apps can appear on screen without taking focus (spotlight I believe has this behavior) and during the app's appearance the shortcuts will still be captured by your application.\r\n3. There's also gonna be those weird one in a thousand situations where somehow you switch focus and the shortcut is not removed."
