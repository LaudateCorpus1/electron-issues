    "body": "Interesting. I replied to your message but it never made it to Github. Anyhow.... Here is what I said earlier:\n\nOn Windows using autofocus attribute or using jQuery to set focus I received the blinking cursor and was able to type without needing to explicitly click the input field. I'll try it on Linux when I get home and see if it works there.\n\nThat said, I just tried this on Linux using both methods (eg, using autofocus=\"true\" and using jQuery to set focus) and both methods are working for me. Perhaps this is an issue isolated to Mac? I wonder if there are any other people here using Mac that can test and verify until an Atom-Shell developer can take a look?\n"
