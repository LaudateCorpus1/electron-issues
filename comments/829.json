It works with 32bit version of the lib, however the build fails with --arch=x64 and 64 lib.\nIs there no 64bit support on windows yet? Is it planned in the future?\n\nAlso is there any downside to this approach? Most common advice I found is to either build a library the \"gyp way\" or use node-ffi.\n\nThanks for replying.\n"
