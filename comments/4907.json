    "body": "Hey, if you're interested in what's going inside Electron, you can find the code [over here](https://github.com/atom/brightray/tree/master/browser) (look for the notification files). The implementations are fairly simple on all three platforms, so if you can't immediately find a feature, it's probably not there - people would probably really like a PR though ;-)\n\nOn Windows, we're not using the latest and greatest Windows 10 notifications, but instead the Windows 8 notification APIs (ensuring that they run well on 8, 8.1, 10). I'm not sure if that's the reason, but that might be why they are not persistent.\n"

It cleared a part, still digging into this.\n\nSlack's notifications are persistent (and it's built on top of Electron as far as we know), so should be a way to do that :) Also, Slack's notifications are persistent on OS X as well - after app's quit they are still in NC.\n\nI still hope someone already has knowledge about this issue to get answers or links to read, for people who aren't into native desktop apps development and actual APIs, known issues, behaviours, etc :)\n"

Can they persist and open app if it's not running, with some params inside, etc?\n\nDuplicate of #3916.\n\n> Is there an option to handle close on OS X? (f.e. to clear it inside app's Notification section as well).\n> Is tag not supported on Windows?
