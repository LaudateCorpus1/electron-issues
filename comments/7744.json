This estimate is not guaranteed and depends on the amount of work involved with upgrading.\n\nhttp://electron.atom.io/docs/faq/#when-will-electron-upgrade-to-latest-chrome\n\nChrome 54 is a much larger jump that previous bumps as Chromium moved from `gyp` to `gn` so it will take longer than usual.\n\nYou can monitor progress here https://github.com/electron/electron/projects/2\n"

It's unclear to me if this has been fixed in Chrome 55, but my users who are on our Electron app are still reporting it, but it is no longer being reported on Chrome 55.\r\n\r\nI know you didn't have a specific timeline, but can you give us any insight into the progress of updating to Chrome 54 and then 55. We're now a couple months behind Chrome, and version 55 apparently had huge memory optimizations.
