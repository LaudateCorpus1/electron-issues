    "body": "@kevinsawicki Just found my error while grepping for `app.setPath`. I realized that I was actually calling `app.getAppPath('userData')` instead of `app.getPath('userData')` -- Small typo and I wasn't cognizant of I was calling.. Oops and thanks!\n\nOn another note, I tried to find the source for `app.getPath` when I thought it wasn't behaving properly for me and found [this](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/28e2058ff108a20dd395ebe5374403381b6d3ff2/atom/common/api/atom_api_asar.cc#L34) Given that I'm not a C++ developer, I have no idea how to make sense of how that works -- but I'd love a quick intro or resources to grok this (fyi -- my only C++ experience is 2 OOP classes in undergrad :/ )\n"
