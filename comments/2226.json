And this is important in what I am trying to do with the spawn/fork.\n\nIs there some way fork can be used along with specifying stdio as well?\n\n[This](https://github.com/swara-app/swara-server/blob/d188b2e49140a8d86c658d8a22f8e8a14d610792/mean-app/libs/spawnhelper.js#L55) is the instance where I am facing all of this problems. Thanks for your help. \n"
