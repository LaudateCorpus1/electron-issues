    "body": "> Cannot run tests\n\nUse [`electron-mocha`](https://github.com/jprichardson/electron-mocha) or your test suite's equivalent.  It runs your tests using the Node runtime provided by electron.\n\nYou can also use the environment variables `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE` to make the `electron` command act the same way `node` does (run a JS script)\n\n> Cannot build electron application.\n\nThis is where you either use either the [two package JSON structure](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder#two-packagejson-structure) that `electron-builder` recommends or wait patiently for my PR into `electron-rebuild` to go through https://github.com/electron/electron-rebuild/pull/98\n\nClosing as it's basically a question that has now been answered (normally I would put some stuff here about please use slack or the discussion forums but you said you had no luck so here's your answer) üëç \n"
