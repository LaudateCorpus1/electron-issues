Do you think users that use your module as a CLI tool or as a dependency are going to be happy to download and install an extra 100MB+ of Electron binaries/resources they have no intention of using?\n\nThe right way to do this is to create a distinct project for your Electron app, and add your module as a dependency of your app.\n"
