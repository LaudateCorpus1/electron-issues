    "body": "The issue you are describing doesn't reconstruct on Windows (at least using your example).\n\nWhen you run the application using `electron .`, your app is actually loaded by the default_app. The default_app creates an environment that is different from the one you get when you publish the app. For example, the default_app registers shortcuts for opening the developer tools and for reloading, which are not available when you publish (unless you add them yourself). So my advice to you is to play with the code of the default_app (specifically `resources/default_app/main.js`) and that will probably lead to some insight.\n"
