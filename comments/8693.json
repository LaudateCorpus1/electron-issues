    "body": "@kevinsawicki have made the changes requested and added some basic coverage for webview zoom behavior. ~~I missed out asking about this in the original PR, the current webview zoom behavior is that it will always inherit the zoom level of parent window unless overriden explicitly by any of the zoom api calls. So webview navigates and returns to the same page will first take the zoom level of the parent. Is this desired, if not when should it inherit parent zoom level ?~~"

So this is the current behavior.\r\n\r\n* when no zoom level is specified for webview it will inherit the parent zoom level.\r\n* when zoom level is specified it will persist across navigations.\r\n* Since there is no host concept for file protocol, the path is used to match the zoom level.\r\n  ```\r\n   let file:///a.html have zoom level 2.0\r\n   Navigate to file:///b.html it will have different zoom level\r\n   Navigate back to file:///a.html , it will have original zoom level of 2.0\r\n   Navigate to file:///a.html#123, it will take parent zoom level not 2.0 since the path is different.\r\n  ```"
