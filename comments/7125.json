Cmd-Alt-I to toggle dev tools and ensure they have focus\n3. Run `document.hasFocus()` in devtools console again\n4. Press Cmd-R to refresh the page via the devtools shortcut (not the Reload menu item, that will only reload the focused window, i.e. devtools\n5. Run `document.hasFocus()` in devtools console again\n\n## Expected behaviour (this is Chrome's behaviour)\n1. After initial page load, devtools console log shows `true` and fiddle panel HTML shows `focus: true`\n2. `document.hasFocus()` returns `false`\n3. After page refresh with devtools focused, console log shows `false` and fiddle HTML shows `focus: false`\n4. `document.hasFocus()` returns `false`\n\n## Actual behaviour (1 and 2 match Chrome)\n1. After initial page load, devtools console log shows `true` and fiddle panel HTML shows `focus: true`\n2. `document.hasFocus()` returns `false`\n3. After page refresh with devtools focused, console log shows `true` and fiddle HTML shows `focus: true`\n4. `document.hasFocus()` returns `true`\n\nIf you change the lines in `default_app.js` at the end of the `load` function as below, steps 1 and 2 also become invalid.\n1. After initial page load, devtools console log shows `true` and fiddle panel HTML shows `focus: true`\n2. `document.hasFocus()` returns `true`\n\nThe initial load should not be focused, and the check from devtools console should _never_ return true.\n\n``` javascript\n    mainWindow = new BrowserWindow(options)\n    mainWindow.hide()\n    mainWindow.loadURL(appUrl)\n    mainWindow.focus()\n    mainWindow.toggleDevTools()\n```\n"
