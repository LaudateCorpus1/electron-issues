    "body": "There is a `-u` option in `bootstrap.py` that can be used to custom the location of libchromiumcontent. This is what I usually do:\n\n``` bash\n$ cd /path/to/libchromiumcontent\n$ ./script/create-dist\n$ mkdir -p win/x64/thecommithashusedbyelectron\n$ mv libchromiumcontent* win/x64/thecommithashusedbyelectron\n$ cd /path/to/electron\n$ ./script/bootstrap.py -v -u file:///path/to/libchromiumcontent/\n```\n\nIf the bootstrap script fails you need to check if `thecommithashusedbyelectron` matches the one used by electron.\n\nIt sucks but since I rarely test electron with custom libchromiumcontent it works fine for me so far.\n"
