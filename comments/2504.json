    "body": "There is precedent for both—XUL famously reimplemented the entire UI framework of every platform they're on, while Qt provides a meticulous API around the native menus.\n\nNative menus are easier to make work with assistive technologies, etc., since they conform to the existing OS APIs. Native menus are also more likely to work with wacky configurations (custom themes, RTL languages, OS-level extensions, programmability, etc.)\n\nThe advantage of emulating the native behavior is that it allows per-app customization using web technologies, which is the main purpose of the Electron project.\n\nPersonally, I lean toward implementing the \"known\" Windows behavior, since it serves the purpose of the project better.\n"

The process of actually getting to them was incredibly, incredibly involved.  But they show up as labeled buttons so all that's needed is:\n- When alt is pressed and released, the menu bar gains focus.\n- When escape is pressed and the menu bar is focused, focus goes back to where it was before.\n- Left and right arrows move between the menus and enter and down arrow both open them.\n- The menus announce the accelerator key.\n\nI saw in another issue that other menus don't do this, which is true.  But they do give you the first letter mnemonic.  Since this menu is not actually a native menu and screen readers aren't going to do this, they need to be labeled with the key.  It's not always the first letter.\n"

(Electron holds the menu open, but no item is selected.)\n> 4) When you have a menu selected, pressing ← or → should take you to the first item in the menu to the left/right, respectively. (Electron ignores the left and right arrow keys.)\n\nI'm not sure if I should open a separate issue, items 3 and 4 are a problem for Linux too.  Confirmed earlier today with latest atom.x86_64.rpm installed on Fedora 24.\n"
