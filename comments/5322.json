    "body": "Hi @bbondy do you know what the status of this PR is?\n\nIn our electron app, the charts disappear (dygraph) if the app stays in the background for too long. This seems to be related to a chromium bug (https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=588434) and using chomium v50 would appear to fix it. So your PR is going to unblock us. Thanks ðŸ˜„ \n"
