    "body": "This seems to be related to your system's language, on Windows with English language, setting `chcp 65001` makes Node.js crash with `Error: write EIO`, while Electron still prints garbage text.\n\nSo I think this is completely an issue of Windows and it is impossible to be fixed. However if you are able to fix the problem, a pull request would be welcomed.\n"
