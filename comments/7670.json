    "body": "Currently access to cache storage apis will check if the origin is secure on both renderer and browser side. It will pass check on renderer since we call `registerURLSchemeAsSecure` but fails on browser and terminates renderer with bad access. Embedders have [ContentClient::AddSecureSchemesAndOrigins](https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/content/public/common/content_client.h?l=153) to fix this.\n\nNon-standard custom schemes will still suffer from this crash since the check involves uniqueness of the [origin](https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/content/browser/cache_storage/cache_storage_dispatcher_host.cc?l=63). Will see if we can disable cache storage.\n\n@pfrazee if you are planning to fix this, can override above mentioned method and insert schemes when `protocol.registerStandardSchemes` is called. Can follow how service worker schemes are registererd. \n"
