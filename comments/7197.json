    "body": "- Does `GOOGLE_API_ENDPOINT` take effect for other services than geolocation ? As far as i know the speech recognition endpoint is hardcoded [here](https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/content/browser/speech/speech_recognition_engine.cc?s&l=35).\n- If the endpoint was just for geolocation then we could have an api on app instead to set the geolocation service, the hack of having to combine endpoint and api key separately for geolocation is not needed when its a service other than the default.\n"
