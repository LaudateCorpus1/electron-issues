Modeless dialogs can also have a Minimize button. Resizable dialogs can have a Maximize button.\n> - Don't disable the Close button. Having a Close button helps users stay in control by allowing them to close windows they don't want.\n>   - Exception: For progress dialogs, you may disable the Close button if the task must run to completion to achieve a valid state or prevent data loss.\n\nThey mention it again in:\n\n> For modeless dialogs, use an explicit Close command button in the dialog to close the window. For both, use a Close button on the title bar to close the window.\n\nThat said, I did a Google image search for TaskDialog and it seems that in practice not everyone follows the guidelines (about half of the dialogs don't have a close button on the title bar).\n\nThanks for the quick response :smile: \n"
