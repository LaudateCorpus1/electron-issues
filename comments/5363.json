    "body": "The locale returned by `app.getLocale` is actually the one used by Chromium internally, which has the same format with `NavigatorLanguage.language`. I don't know why Chromium chose a different format for its `i18n` API.\n\nI think we should make this explicit in documents, changing the behavior may not be a good idea since it will break apps that rely on `app.getLocale`.\n"
