    "body": "Dug in some more, here are my current findings:\nWhen at 150% display size, the cursor is reporting the wrong position.  Here's a quick screenshot I put together:\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4733304/18847027/5d5a56ee-83dd-11e6-83fd-9a9ff71477dc.png)\n\nQuick overview for the colors / how to read this:\n- red colored divs are ones w/ `-webkit-app-region: drag`\n- yellow colored divs are ones w/ `-webkit-app-region: no-drag`\n- blue colored divs are ones I manually plotted (coords obtained by dumping the RECTs out of the draggable_region member variable using an iterator. This change was made in `atom/browser/ui/views/frameless_view.cc`::NonClientHitTest())\n\nYou'll also notice (gotta look close) a brown X in the bottom right.  I added some code to electron to write the cursor position and noticed that:\n- in the above example, I physically put my cursor where the brown X is (bottom right)\n- electron reports the coordinates for my cursor being where the aqua colored X is (above and left of the brown X).  This is off by ~277 pixels on the X axis and 27 on the Y axis.\n\nLooking deeper into the code now...\n"

    "body": "No progress made, still digging. The hitboxes which exist in draggable_region are correct.  However, the mouse coordinates are not. Since my resolution is set to 150%, I can get the proper coordinates by multiplying the x and y by 1.5.  I'm trying to find the code which is capturing the mouse coordinates, to understand why it's capturing them wrong.\n"
