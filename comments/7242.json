    "body": "@ajaxboy Please direct questions / code help request to the community discussion forums or to slack.  The github issues section is intended to be only used for bugs with Electron.\n\nI'll answer your question anyway though 👍 \n\nTo check if a file exists you want to use [`fs.stat`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_stat_path_callback)\n\nSample code would be\n\n``` js\nconst pathToFile = '/path/to/my/file';\nfs.stat((err) => {\n  if (err) {\n    // File does not exist\n  } else {\n    // File does exist\n  }\n});\n```\n\nAnd before anyone else says \"you should use fs.exists\", that method is deprecated so using it is a super bad idea.\n"
