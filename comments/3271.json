There's probably multiple strategies for keeping this stuff in sync. The cleanest way is probably to change the tarball build process to reference a different Chromium source branch/repo. Alternatively you can build the tarball yourself and reference it directly in the libchromiumcontent update script.\n"

    "body": "Forgive my ignorance, but I'm curious: is it possible for the Electron team to cherrypick the WebVR changeset (and permit the flag to be enabled) without having to wait for WebVR to hit release channel (Chrome 55, as @jcarpenter mentions [above](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/3271#issuecomment-242952641)).\n\nFrom my naïve poking around of Electron and its dependencies, it seems to be an elaborate process to merge and uplift changes from Chromium proper to Electron's Chromium source. Is there any (clever) way to get around that? If not – and I definitely won't expect any precise date – but what do y'all think is roughly the timeframe WebVR (in whichever form, its current experimental form in @toji's Chromium builds or the upcoming stable/upstream builds) will be available to consume from Electron?\n"
