    "body": "Yeah, this happens for me for several Electron apps, including Atom, Discord, WhatsApp and some others. However, this happens for Airmail 3 which (I believe) is not an Electron app.\r\nSymptoms are all the same: after `killall Dock` (or reboot) the icon of the app is question mark and doesn't work anymore. Removing it from the Dock and dragging back to Dock helps till the next reboot. Sometimes I observed two identical icons, one with light no (app running) both switching to app. After `killall Dock` one becomes question mark. \r\nSometimes after I reboot I see the icon intact, however, when I click it, the **second** icon of the same app appears alongside the first one and starts jumping.\r\nI'm running Sierra 10.12.5 Beta (16F67a), however, I was able to reproduce with 10.12.3 & 4.\r\nRight now it reproduces 99% of my reboots. I can run any tests you like."
