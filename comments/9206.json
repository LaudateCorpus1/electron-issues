    "body": "> globalShortcut.register('Super+Space', function(){\r\n\r\nThis method returns a boolean on whether it was successful or not and with your example it returns `false` for me on Windows 10. This suggests that this key combination is reserved by Windows and so applications cannot use it.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if a list exists of all thereserved hot keys, but http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11767458/how-do-you-register-a-custom-winv-hotkey-on-windows-8 has some interesting discussion.\r\n\r\nThe Windows docs only state:\r\n\r\n> Either WINDOWS key was held down. These keys are labeled with the Windows logo. Keyboard shortcuts that involve the WINDOWS key are reserved for use by the operating system.\r\n\r\nhttps://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms646309(v=vs.85).aspx\r\n\r\nI was able to get a super combination to register and fire though so it does seem possible, you just need to pick one that is allowed by the OS, the one that worked for me was:\r\n\r\n```js\r\napp.once('ready', () => {\r\n  const ret = globalShortcut.register('super+control+b', () => {\r\n    console.log('pressed!')\r\n  })\r\n\r\n  if (!ret) {\r\n    console.log('registration failed')\r\n  }\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo I'm going to close this issue out since this seems to be a limitation of Windows where only certain super shortcuts are allowed to be registered."
