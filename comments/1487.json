    "body": "We've definitely been noticing this with Slack. Some AV block our network traffic outright, resulting in blank white-screens and confounded users. The better vendors (AVG, Kaspersky) have false positive forms that you can fill out, typically linked from their Support page. Some of them are fascists and will ask that you reproduce the issue (requiring you to first pay for their product or install a trial) and send them the logs from an instance when the app is blocked (here's looking at you, Symantec).\n\nWhen filing these whitelist requests, I've thus far included details about Electron / Squirrel and pointed out that these problems will apply to a number of other applications. So hopefully at some point we can reach a critical mass.\n"
