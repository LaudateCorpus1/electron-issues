    "body": "I second this. Having the ability to restrict the application to use integrated graphics would be great. We use Electron to host a small tray UI and driver for a POS pin pad. We then start and execute transactions from the client's browser through a socket server to the electron app. It's quite a nice solution as we can start transactions from any device via a web browser but If election is sucking back a lot of power then it may limit the experience. Any efficiency gains here would be awesome. It would enable our clients to be more mobile with their business."
