    "body": "On Windows, I think it's necessary to track the mouse events by calling the [TrackMouseEvent function](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms646265%28v=vs.85%29.aspx) in order to be able to receive the `WM_MOUSELEAVE` message.\n\nI don't fully comprehend how and where `atom-shell` handles windows messages. Where do I actually find the message loop?\n\nAnyhow, this is _basically_ how chromium (Google Chrome) seems to do it in their `HWNDMessageHandler` class.\n\n``` c++\nif (message == WM_MOUSEMOVE || message == WM_NCMOUSEMOVE)\n{\n    // Windows only fires WM_MOUSELEAVE events if the application begins\n    // \"tracking\" mouse events for a given HWND during WM_MOUSEMOVE events.\n    // We need to call |TrackMouseEvents| to listen for WM_MOUSELEAVE.\n    TrackMouseEvents((message == WM_NCMOUSEMOVE) ? TME_NONCLIENT | TME_LEAVE : TME_LEAVE);\n}\nelse if (message == WM_MOUSELEAVE || message == WM_NCMOUSELEAVE)\n{\n    // Reset our tracking flags so future mouse movement over this\n    // window results in a new tracking session.\n    active_mouse_tracking_flags_ = 0;\n}\n```\n\n``` c++\nvoid HWNDMessageHandler::TrackMouseEvents(DWORD mouse_tracking_flags) {\n    // Begin tracking mouse events for this HWND so that we get WM_MOUSELEAVE\n    // when the user moves the mouse outside this HWND's bounds.\n    if (active_mouse_tracking_flags_ == 0 || mouse_tracking_flags & TME_CANCEL)\n    {\n        if (mouse_tracking_flags & TME_CANCEL)\n        {\n            // We're about to cancel active mouse tracking, so empty out the stored\n            // state.\n            active_mouse_tracking_flags_ = 0;\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            active_mouse_tracking_flags_ = mouse_tracking_flags;\n        }\n\n        TRACKMOUSEEVENT tme;\n        tme.cbSize = sizeof(tme);\n        tme.dwFlags = mouse_tracking_flags;\n        tme.hwndTrack = hwnd();\n        tme.dwHoverTime = 0;\n        TrackMouseEvent(&tme);\n    }\n    else if (mouse_tracking_flags != active_mouse_tracking_flags_)\n    {\n        TrackMouseEvents(active_mouse_tracking_flags_ | TME_CANCEL);\n        TrackMouseEvents(mouse_tracking_flags);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n`DWORD active_mouse_tracking_flags_` is a member variable initialized with `0`. The code get's slightly more complicated, when incorporating `SetCapture` and `ReleaseCapture` for proper right-click handling on the caption bar (\"to ensure we only show the sys-menu when the button down and up are both on the caption\").\n"
