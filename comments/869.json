    "body": "@iamdriz I still need to write that up in the README, but basic usage is this.  This must be done inside the renderer process\n\n``` js\nrequire('electron-chromecast')((receivers) => {\n    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n        resolve(receivers[0]);\n    });\n});\n```\n\nThe module returns a function that you call with a single parameter.  This parameter should be a function that accepts a parameter `receivers` which is an array of [`Receiver`](https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/reference/chrome/chrome.cast.Receiver) objects.  \n\nThis method will be called as part of the standard process of calling [`chrome.cast.requestSession()`](https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/reference/chrome/chrome.cast#.requestSession).  It will be called with all available receivers and you must resolve it with the one you want to connect to.\n\nOther than that one function you need to implement the entire usage process is identical to the [`chrome.cast` API](https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/reference/chrome/chrome.cast)\n"
