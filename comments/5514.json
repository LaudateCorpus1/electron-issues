    "body": "A lot of deprecations were removed for 1.0 â€“ one of the things that was deprecated was `require` ing Electron-specific modules globally (ie. `const shell = require('shell')`, or `import shell from 'shell`. You'll need to update your app to import these properties from the `electron` module:\n\n``` js\nimport {shell} from 'electron';\nconst {shell} = require('electron');\n```\n\nHope that helps!\n\nAlso, [we're trying to control the amount of Issues that we have to triage and track](http://blog.atom.io/2016/04/19/managing-the-deluge-of-atom-issues.html). For general questions, [the Electron message board](https://discuss.atom.io/c/electron) or the [Electron Slack channel](http://atom-slack.herokuapp.com/) is where you'll probably be able to find answers faster.\n"
