    "body": "I was just trying what you said, after poking around in the C++ too.  I've updated my https://github.com/todbot/electron-tray-test example with a boolean to switch between attaching a contextMenu at Tray creation vs on click event.\n\nI initially abstained from this implementation after the docs said \"do not rely on `click` event\".  Is that no longer a concern? \n\nInstead of calling `tray.setContextMenu()` on tray creation the attaching of contextMenus in the `click` or `right-click` event with `tray.popUpContextMenu()` appears to work on both MacOSX and Windows.  Thanks!\n\nThis solves my problem, in which I wanted to have a menu that can change and not close on the user mid-change, since I recreate the menu on click.  (though in retrospect some docs in Tray explaining the two approaches to handling Trays would have been very helpful)\n"
