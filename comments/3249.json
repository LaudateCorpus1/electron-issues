They cannot be required directly. In order to use them, IPC is necessary. `remote` allows to hide the details of IPC and provides an easy way to use `main process` API from the renderer process.\n\nIf this is correct, are you interested in a a new PR with this change?\nThanks for your work.\n\nrgds\n"

In order to use them from the render process, the `ipc` module is necessary to send inter-process messages to the main process. With the `remote` module, you can invoke methods of the main process object without explicitly sending inter-process messages, similar to Java's RMI.\n"
