    "body": "In the Info.plist file you'll find a key-value pair where the value is \"atom.icns\". In the \"Resources\" folder you'll find a file named \"atom.icns\". Now you have two possibilities:\n1) replace this file with your icon \n2) change the value in Info.plist and add your icon file to the \"Resources\" folder. Make sure you have your icon in the `icns` format\n\nDue to Finder's caching you should then copy your application to another folder so Finder has to update its icon cache; otherwise you'll see the old icon for the next time.\n\nAdditional tip: In Info.plist, you can also change the title of your application (Bundle Display Name, Bundle Name), so the first entry in your application menu will be your application's name rather than \"Atom Shell\"\n"
