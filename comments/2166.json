    "body": "Hi @zcbenz, thanks for the quick fix. I know little about the internals of Electron and not sure what https://github.com/atom/electron/commit/260ec96edd9fad146ddbbf3be4abcf483d59c501 does exactly.\n\nIf an iframe's `window.open(url)` is called from its parent's JS context, which document will be used to resolve the relative `url`, the parent's or the child's? The correct answer is the the parent's. see https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1044950#c2\nHowever I suspect your fix always takes the child's base URL to resolve the relative `url`.\n"

    "body": "With the last change (the one that always uses `window.top.document` to resolve relative URLs) calling  `window.open()` from within an iframe no longer works. I currently see no easy fix to properly handle both cases, but I'd argue that the case where an iframe wants to open a URL relative to itself is much more common. Can we re-open the issue or should I file a new one? \n"
