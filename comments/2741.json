    "body": "I'd really like this to be fixed. I currently can't get `debug-brk` working with any of the debuggers which I have tried.\n\n**Edit:** I have realised that this is unlikely the cause of the problem.\n\nLooking at Node.js' [`/src/node.cc`](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/2e6ece44e176f70a9c5c03879f4c98b912c7afbd/src/node.cc#L3928-L3938):\n\n``` cc\n// Start debug agent when argv has --debug\nif (instance_data->use_debug_agent())\n  StartDebug(env, debug_wait_connect);\n\nLoadEnvironment(env);\n\nenv->set_trace_sync_io(trace_sync_io);\n\n// Enable debugger\nif (instance_data->use_debug_agent())\n  EnableDebug(env);\n```\n\n[`LoadEnvironment`](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/2e6ece44e176f70a9c5c03879f4c98b912c7afbd/src/node.cc#L2967) will load [`/src/node.js`](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/src/node.js), and call its top-level function, passing the `process` object:\n\n``` cc\nLocal<Value> arg = env->process_object();\nf->Call(global, 1, &arg);\n```\n\nIt appears that they are only enabling the debug agent after the environment has been loaded. Perhaps this is what causes Node.js to _not_ break as early as Electron.\n"
