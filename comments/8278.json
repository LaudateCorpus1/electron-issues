    "body": "@demian85 experiencing somewhat the same behaviour (see https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/8246). Where the desktopcapturer freezes the entire process and it's windows for a brief moment when calling getSources() - did you experience that as well. I'm having that issue on all three platforms though. \r\n\r\nThe developers of KAP (https://github.com/wulkano/kap) also experienced performance issues they said (in https://github.com/wulkano/kap/issues/20) - and therefore implemented their own capturing logic on macOS, but unfortunately haven't worked on Windows or Linux tooling for the capturing process."
