Browsers use it, and browser-like apps could use it (a photo app to swipe through photos for e.g.), but not code editors and many other types of desktop apps.\n\nThis feature was created by Apple for desktop apps. Web apps don't use it. Browser's (which are desktop apps that access the internet) do. Desktop image apps use it. There may be other types of applications that could use it.\n\nIn addition, apps that are built for the web but work offline in a desktop app could provide a consistent experience in and out of the browser if this feature was enabled.\n\nClosing out since this is covered by #1486. I was searching for swipe and should have expended the issue search for gestures.\n"
