    "body": "Electron is just calling the API provided by Chromium, I guess it is a feature that window loading is synchronous, so Chromium won't start lots of connections at the same time.\n\nI don't think there is a way to make loadURL async, Chromium doesn't provide related APIs. I'm closing this as won't fix since it is probably very hard to solve and doesn't worth the effort.\n"
