    "body": "I don't see how this is an issue with Electron.  It appears to be an issue with a completely different NPM package failing to install on your system.\n\nA cursory google search indicates that install `libjpeg-dev` will solve your issue.\n\n``` bash\nsudo apt-get install libjpeg-dev\n```\n\nIn the future, please keep the Electron issue section only for Electron specific issues üëç \n"
