    "body": "@zcbenz Thanks for looking at this. Shold this really be considered a duplicate of #1374, though? The [Chrome-app `webview` dialog events](https://developer.chrome.com/apps/tags/webview#event-dialog) that #1374 refers to only include modal dialogs created by `window.alert`, `window.confirm`, or `window.prompt`. These may be quite different in nature from file-upload events: the former three involve only passing string or boolean values, while the latter involves the creation of `File` objects using information outside the web page's sandbox (something not normally possible; cf. #749).\n"
