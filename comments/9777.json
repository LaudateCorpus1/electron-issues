    "body": "@cifratila thanks for reply,but I don't know  how to know the video encode,I just use webrtc api ,electron can use the vedio stream to show the image,but when i open new one ,the new window will throw the error,I submit a issue on webtrc org and somebody said cameras can only be used by a single processï¼ŒI don't know how to solve it,like the chrome can run two pages."
