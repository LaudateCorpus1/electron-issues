    "body": "> Adding an App to an App Group\n> The com.apple.security.application-groups (available in OS X v10.7.5 and v10.8.3 and later) allows multiple apps produced by a single development team to share access to a special group container. This container is intended for content that is not user-facing, such as shared caches or databases.\n> In addition, this attribute allows the apps within the group to share Mach and POSIX semaphores and to use certain other IPC mechanisms among the group’s members. For additional details and naming conventions, read “Mach IPC and POSIX Semaphores and Shared Memory” in App Sandbox Design Guide.\n> **The value for this key must be of type array**, and must contain one or more string values, each of which must consist of your development team ID, followed by a period, followed by an arbitrary name chosen by your development team. For example:\n> \n> ``` <key>com.apple.security.application-groups</key>\n> <array>\n>     <string>DG29478A379Q6483R9214.HolstFirstAppSuite</string>\n>     <string>DG29478A379Q6483R9214.HolstSecondAppSuite</string>\n> </array>\n> ```\n> \n> The group containers are automatically created or added into each app’s sandbox container as determined by the existence of these keys. The group containers are stored in ~/Library/Group Containers/<application-group-id>, where <application-group-id> is one of the strings from the array. Your app can obtain the path to the group containers by calling the containerURLForSecurityApplicationGroupIdentifier: method of NSFileManager.\n\n@slaskis Seems that `com.apple.security.application-groups` needs an array, rather than a single string?\n\nRef: https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Miscellaneous/Reference/EntitlementKeyReference/Chapters/EnablingAppSandbox.html\n"
