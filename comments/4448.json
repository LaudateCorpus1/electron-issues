    "body": "@kevinsawicki \nI think there is 3 points to be satisfied\n1. non-enumerable props in prototype chain are exposed as non-enumerable.\n2. for-in like enumeration get same results whether used with the remote module or not.\n3. function Klass() {} style declaration is also works (**important**)\n\npoint 1 is derived from related issue (ES2015 class method is non-enumerable)\npoint 2 is for the consistent behavior between browser process and renderer process.\npoint 3 is also consistent behavior for forward.\n\nand my verify code -> https://gist.github.com/berlysia/c4b2ae2525176d8f9f33\n\nbut now I noticed, this PR's code is not satisfied above(point 3). This problem needs more consideration.\nI'll close this PR. I'm sorry to cause you trouble.\n"
