Or another silly way is using an interceptor in v8 for setter and throw if key is not already present on the object. @zcbenz any ideas for implementation ? also should we change the remote object creation to use `defineProperty` instead of `__defineMethods__` which are non-standard https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/__defineGetter__ ?\n"
