    "body": "I patched my local install of Atom to not blow up on the missing callback. In dialog.js, I added `callback &&`: \n\n```\n  return binding.showOpenDialog(String(options.title), String(options.defaultPath), properties, window, function(success, result) {\n    return callback && callback(success ? result : void 0);\n  });\n}\n```\n\nWith this patch in place, I grabbed dougnukem's [hello-atom](https://github.com/dougnukem/hello-atom), and inside of main.js I added:\n\n```\nconsole.log(require('dialog').showOpenDialog({}))\n```\n\nSo the `ready` callback now looks like this:\n\n```\napp.on('ready', function() {\n  // Create the browser window.\n  mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({width: 800, height: 600});\n\n  // and load the index.html of the app.\n  mainWindow.loadUrl('file://' + __dirname + '/index.html');\n\n  console.log(require('dialog').showOpenDialog({}))\n\n  // Emitted when the window is closed.\n  mainWindow.on('closed', function() {\n    // Dereference the window object, usually you would store windows\n    // in an array if your app supports multi windows, this is the time\n    // when you should delete the corresponding element.\n    mainWindow = null;\n  });\n})\n```\n\nWhen running hello-atom against the patched Atom, I get:\n1. `showOpenDialog()` returns immediately and prints `undefined` to the console.\n2. The dialog is still open waiting for user input\n3. Choosing a file in the dialog then closes the dialog\n\n_expected:_ some way to get the path the user chose\n_actual:_ there is no way (at least that I can find anyway). `showOpenDialog()` is long gone and there are no hooks to get at the user's decision.\n\nIf you provide a callback to `showOpenDialog()`, then inside the callback the chosen path is provided as expected.\n\nThis is on OSX Mavericks, using Atom 0.13.0, with the minor patch added.\n"
