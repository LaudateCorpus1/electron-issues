It is highly unlikely they will support it again. They traditionally do not support operating systems that are no longer maintained by the developer.\r\n\r\n> Earlier this year, we announced that Google Chrome would continue support for Windows XP through the remainder of 2015. At that time, we strongly encouraged users on older, unsupported platforms such as Windows XP to update to a supported, secure operating system. Such older platforms are missing critical security updates and have a greater potential to be infected by viruses and malware.\r\n>\r\n> Today, we’re announcing the end of Chrome’s support for Windows XP, as well as Windows Vista, and Mac OS X 10.6, 10.7, and 10.8, since these platforms are no longer actively supported by Microsoft and Apple. Starting April 2016, Chrome will continue to function on these platforms but will no longer receive updates and security fixes.\r\n>\r\n> If you are still on one of these unsupported platforms, we encourage you to move to a newer operating system to ensure that you continue to receive the latest Chrome versions and features.\r\n>\r\n> Posted by Marc Pawliger, Director of Engineering and Early Notifier\r\n\r\nWhen they say it will continue to run they are referring to older versions, not new releases. So once it breaks, it stays broken and they raise the install requirement."
