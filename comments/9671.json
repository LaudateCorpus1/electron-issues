It seems showing the window early works, except for this color inconsistency."

    "body": "This bug has also been affecting me for some time. It's trivial to reproduce by creating a window with a `backgroundColor` option and an HTML template with the same background color value in the body (let me know if you need more). I'm using `rgb(0, 43, 54)` and it is rendered as `rgb(0, 57, 69)` (value found using the Mac digital color meter). Any idea what might be causing this?"
