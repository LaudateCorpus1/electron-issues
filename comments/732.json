So this isn't a viable fix.\n\nIn any case, is there a way to stop Atom offsetting the window when in frameless mode and maximized???\n"

I'm going to implement a frameless app tomorrow with a custom title bar and see if I can make it do the right thing.\n"

Win32 code while looking horrible is quite fascinating to me. LOL!\n"
