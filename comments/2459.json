    "body": "Can we refactor this to use a new BrowserContext for each partition instead of allocating a new request context for each partition in one BrowserContext? \n\nThe trouble comes from the cookies API because it assumes each BrowserContext has only one request context however this implementation breaks this assumption, the consequence is we are not able to use cookies API for the webview partitions unless we add a new bunch of APIs by mapping RequestContext to JavaScript. And in future it will add more and more trouble when we try to add more APIs around BrowserContext.\n\nHowever simply mapping each partition to a new BrowserContext solves all the troubles, we no longer need to manage the whole storage partition things, and our APIs keep simple.\n"
