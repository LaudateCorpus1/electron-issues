    "body": "@zcbenz, what about moving `appData` and `userData` to `%LOCALAPPCACHE%` like in Chrome and Chromium (see  the comments above by @felicienfrancois and @jorangreef)?\n\nI think we should change the [code](https://github.com/atom/electron/blob/01d2765e4b566df853cd583006ebc7993d48cd38/atom/browser/lib/init.coffee#L93-L94), so we will first test if the `userData` folder exists under `%APPDATA%`, if it does we won't change anything, if it doesn't (meaning it's a new install), we will use `%LOCALAPPDATA%`. That way, we won't break the experience of current users and slowly everyone will move to the new location.\n\nRoaming should be avoided since each enterprise uses different quotas and some times they are just ridiculously low. If a developer wants the data to be synchronized between installs, he/she should use some server side mechanism and not rely on roaming (of course, they can still use `app.setPath()` to change it back, if they really need roaming).\n"

I also have a desktop which I use from time to time. I left ACME open on my laptop and started working on my PC where I also open ACME. I do a bunch of stuff there that modify userData (Local Storage, indexedDB etc.) and then I close it. The data is supposed to be synced, but I won't actually see it. Once I close ACME on my laptop the data will be rewritten so the sync disappears. When I open ACME again on the desktop, it's userData would change to the data from the laptop. I lost what ever I stored in Local Storage.\n\nThe point of this contrived story, is that roaming doesn't really work for Electron (and of course Chrome/Chromium). If you really want to sync settings/configuration you should implement that yourself. If we would have used `%LOCALAPPDATA%` the results would have been different. Each instance would have it's own data and that data would persist on that machine. `%LOCALAPPDATA%` at the very least is predictable.\n"

For instance we have a small percentage of our workforce who are remote workers, as such they very sensitive to network bandwidth and latency.
