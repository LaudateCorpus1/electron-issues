    "body": "`webview` has issues being hidden or using `display: none;`. It causes the behaviour you're seeing here as well as reloading the current page when un-hidden, as opposed to just becoming visible again.\n\nThe `webview` and child `browserplugin` object occupy the correct dimensions in your testcase, it's just the `browserplugin` is not rendering to fill its updated dimensions, cause because the `webview` was hidden.\n\nIf the best workaround, is to set the `webview` CSS to `{ width: 0px; height: 0px; flex: 0 1; }`. This will effectively hide it, and not cause the adverse side effects of `display: none;`/`hidden`\n[electron-webview-resize-bug-workaround.zip](https://github.com/electron/electron/files/215456/electron-webview-resize-bug-workaround.zip)\n\nI will update the `webview` documentation to make note of this behaviour and the workaround.\n"
