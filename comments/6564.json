    "body": "You haven't given your MathJax configuration, but I suspect that you have not turned off the font cache, so the SVG contains `<use>` tag that reference a global SVG element for the actual path data.  That will make the SVG no be self-contained, as needed for the `<img>` tag.\n\nTry adding\n\n```\n<script type=\"text/x-mathjax-config\">\nMathJax.Hub.Config({\n  SVG: {useFontCache: false}\n});\n</script>\n```\n\nto your page just _before_ the script that loads `MathJax.js` itself.  That will make each SVG be self contained, with no `<use>` tags.\n\nIf that doesn't work, attach an `onerror` handler to your `img` and see if that gets called.  \n\nFinally, you might want to attach the `onload` handler to the `img` _before_ setting the `src` attribute, just in case there is a race condition.\n"
