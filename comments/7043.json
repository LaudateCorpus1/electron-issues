    "body": "> I can enable all flags that I need. \n\nSo why do you still need Chromium experimental?\n\nAs mentioned before it is quite a complicated process.  `libchromiumcontent` is basically a series of patch files and build scripts that pre-compiles a \"slightly\" modified version of Chromium.  This pre-compiled artifact is then used when building Electron.\n\n> I copied all these files into chromium_src folder\n\nIt is no where near this simple, you can't just copy and paste a bunch of unknown heavily modified source files into Electron as all sorts of things have changed inside Chromium between the current version and the experimental version.\n\nAlso I forgot this in the first comment but all questions should be directed to the Discussion Forums or to Slack.  Github is for issues only üëç \n"
