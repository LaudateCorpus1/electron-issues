    "body": "@darwin, I think you are over estimating the amount of devtools extensions and their popularity. The number of devtools extensions that people are actually using (or trying to use) is pretty low. If you search the issues, you'll see most just want to use some framework inspector (AngularJS Batarang, React Developer Tools or Ember Inspector) and currently all of them are not working (see #915).\n\nLists are helpful (take for example the [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) lists project). The list doesn't have to contain information about every single extension, but if they do contain it for something that you are interested in, it can save you time. A list might also help you discover some cool extensions you didn't know existed.\n\nIt would be great if Extension authors would mention their support for Electron in their docs, but currently they don't. It's also customary to say what you support and not what you don't support, so I doubt all the framework inspectors will want to currently state in their docs that they don't support Electron.\n"
