And I suspect this issue will be closed due to the same conclusion. This wouldn't be as easy as changing some code and getting it to build for Android. There are a lot of incompatibilities and roadblocks preventing this from ever taking off."

I'm working on one right now. \r\n\r\nAnything that runs in a browser will run on all the platforms already and there are surprisingly few areas where native functionality overlaps. Even where it does overlap, why should the electron team attempt to solve a problem solved long ago by cordova?\r\n\r\nThe platform detection is trivial and for each you load different wrapper implementations depending on what is supported on that platform. I have a few simple wrappers which give a common interfaces over `fs` on electron and `cordova-plugin-file` on cordova, `powerSaveBlocker` on electron and `Insomnia-PhoneGap-Plugin` on cordova, `chrome.serial` on ChromeOS and `node-serialport` on electron, `cordova-plugin-bluetoothle` on cordova, `chrome.bluetooth` on ChromeOS, `sandeepmistry/noble` on electron, etc, etc.\r\n\r\nThe most complicated thing by far is getting the the build process setup to target all the different platforms and this can be achieved in the community with a few simple boilerplates."
