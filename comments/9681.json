    "body": "Actually, I realized that this problem does not appear on another machine, where the GTK2 theme being used has no GTK3 variant. It looks like the apps fall back to GTK2 then where the problem does not appear. So I suspect that this is a problem in the GTK3 implementation, isn't it? If electron used GTK2 rather than GTK3, as #2927 indicates, the problem should not appear on the original machine, like it doesn't appear on the machine with a GTK2 only theme. Maybe my reasoning has some flaw? ðŸ˜„ "
