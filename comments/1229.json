    "body": "This behavior -- silently altering message data -- is pretty bad.\n\nI understand that we don't want to parse recursive objects. But this isn't a recursive object. At least it's not an object that is problematic to parse. If it were cyclical then I would completely understand, but it's not.\n\nIn any case, if Atom-Shell can't deal with the message data as it is, why would it **silently** alter it?? It seems that throwing an error would be far more appropriate than silently changing my data structure.\n"
