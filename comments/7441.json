    "body": "I don't think there is a leak. Ownership of the `data` allocated in [`AtomBlobReader::BlobReadHelper::DidReadBlobData()`](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/atom/browser/atom_blob_reader.cc#L131) is transferred to a Node Buffer in [`RunCallbackInUI()`](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/atom/browser/atom_blob_reader.cc#L35), when the Node Buffer is destroyed it should free the underlying `data`. However, the Node Buffer will deallocate `data` using `free()` rather than `delete[]`, which I believe puts us in undefined behavior territory. Is this something that needs to be fixed up @deepak1556 ?\n"
