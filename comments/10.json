    "body": "I'm now implementing the file dialog API for Windows, but the problem is: the standard Windows file dialog does not support selecting both files and directories, and there is no way to select multiple directories too. The same limitation exists in GTK+, so we would face the same problem when porting atom-shell on Linux.\n\nThe only solution is to create custom file dialogs, but the work would be quite large, and it's very hard to make them behave similar to the standard ones. So I think maybe we should just separate the open of files from directories in Atom?\n\n/cc @probablycorey @kevinsawicki @nathansobo \n"
