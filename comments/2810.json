    "body": "Yeah… this is because the hidden-inset style creates a window toolbar for styling, which is not visible in windowed mode, but is there in fullscreen mode. With a normal toolbar, there would be some buttons there (e.g look at Safari in fullscreen mode), but we just use this to inset the buttons so it contains nothing.\n\nWhat do you think would be appropriate behavior? I’m thinking to just remove the toolbar for hidden-inset style in fullscreen mode, and restore the toolbar when going back from fullscreen to windowed mode. So in fullscreen case, hidden and hidden-inset styles would look the same, \n"
