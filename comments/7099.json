    "body": "@kevinsawicki Thanks for your comment :)\n\nI wasn't, but I've edited the main.js file with the following:\n\n```\napp.on('gpu-process-crashed', function () {\n  console.log(\"GPU process crashed\");\n});\n\napp.on('crashed', function () {\n  console.log(\"Crashed\");\n});\n```\n\nAnd in the createWindow() function:\n\n```\n  mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({\"kiosk\": false})\n\n  mainWindow.on('crashed', function () {\n    console.log('Main window crashed');\n  })\n\n  mainWindow.on('gpu-process-crashed', function () {\n    console.log('Main Window GPU process crashed');\n  });\n```\n\nI wasn't sure where to listen for those events so I put them in those two places. Anyway, none of them is fired. Nothing in the logs. As I said in the original post I'm writing console.log every 500ms to see if the app is still alive and after a few interactions with the app (or opening the DevTools) the logging just stops and the page goes blank.\n\nAny ideas?\n"

When we increased the memory, it went smoothly.\n\nWe made this:\n- edit the file /etc/fstab and change /dev/shm value from 8M to 996M\n- mount -o remount /dev/shm\n\nThanks for the help!\n"
