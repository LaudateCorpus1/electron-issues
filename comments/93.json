Can you have a review of the `ShowOpenDialog` function and see if I missed something?\n\nCalling `require('remote').require('dialog').showOpenDialog({defaultPath: 'C:\\\\', properties: ['openFile', 'openDirectory']});` in renderer could test this function.\n"

You can't pop a dialog in Windows (or in Mac afaik) where you can return a list that has both files and folders in it\n"

    "body": "@paulcbetts I meant `dialog.showOpenDialog(properties: ['openFile', 'openDirectory'])` should be able to return either a single file or a single folder, but on Windows if `openDirectory` (e.g. `FOS_PICKFOLDERS`) is set the dialog would only be able to select a folder. In #10 you said it it was possible so I wonder if I missed something.\n\nOn Mac `dialog.showOpenDialog(properties: ['openFile', 'openDirectory', 'multiSelections'])` would return a list of both files and folders, and Atom relies on this behavior for its `Open` menu.\n"
