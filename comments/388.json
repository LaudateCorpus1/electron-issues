('It' here being Chromium's devtools_http_client.cc; it requires something like 'Chrome/36.0.1985.125')\nOn OSX, Chrome is getting this value from the Info.plist in the app package: <CFBundleName>/<CFBundleShortVersionString>\n\nSo I hacked those values to be 'Chrome' and '36.0.1985.125' as above and I can successfully launch my Atom app. I've not fully put it through paces, but `driver.navigate.to()` and `driver.execute_script()` seemed to work. \n"
