    "body": "@zcbenz I am on 10.10.5 and as mentioned before already, I start to see this error starting with electron 0.31.0 and 0.31.1. I tried today again many hours to find a reproducible scenario, but failed. I can make this error show up as soon as I cp.fork() a JS file from within a VS Code renderer window with the following code:\n\n``` javascript\nvar foo = typeof console;\n\nprocess.on(\"message\", function() {\n\n});\n```\n\nProduces:\n\nError: UnknownSystemError: Unknown system error, uv_pipe_open\n\nSomehow it is already sufficient to access the console property and my forked process blows up. I can not make this happen from a bare electron app though.\n\nInterestingly, I still see this error when my code on the renderer side is as simple as this:\n\n``` html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n    <head>\n        <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n        <title>Visual Studio Code</title>\n\n        <!-- Helpers -->\n        <script type=\"text/javascript\">\n            var cp = require('child_process');\n\n            var res = cp.fork('/path to JS file');\n            res.on('exit', function() {\n                console.log('exit')\n            })\n        </script>\n    </head>\n    <body>\n    </body>\n</html>\n```\n\nThis makes me wonder if anything on the main side could possibly have an impact on this issue.

    "body": "@zcbenz Here is very simple code that causes the error. I'm justing calling require('chalk') in renderer process. That was enough to reproduce the issue.\n\nWhen you open the child window by clicking on the button in the main window, you would notice the error in the console logs.\n\nwith just 1 renderer process - issue doesn't occur\nwith 2 renderer processes - issue occurs.\n\nHowever, if you remove all the console logs messages from main.js, then this error disappears. Looks like its definitely something to do with process.stdout(). Hope this helps..\n\n**main.js**\n\n``` javascript\nvar app = require('app'),\n    ipc = require('ipc'),\n    BrowserWindow = require('browser-window');\n\nvar mainWindow = null;\n    childWindow = null;\n\napp.on('window-all-closed', function() {\n    if (process.platform != 'darwin') {\n        app.quit();\n    }\n});\n\napp.on('ready', function() {\n    mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({\n        width: 480,\n        height: 640,\n    });\n    mainWindow.loadUrl('file://' + __dirname + '/main.html');\n\n    mainWindow.on('closed', function() {\n        mainWindow = null;\n    });\n\n    ipc.on('child:open', function(event) {\n        console.log('main.js :: ipc msg child:open received');\n        openChildWindow();\n    });\n\n    openChildWindow = function() {\n        if (!!childWindow) {\n            console.log('main.js :: child window already open');\n            childWindow.focus();\n        } else {\n            console.log('main.js :: create a new child window');\n            childWindow = new BrowserWindow({\n                width: 1080,\n                height: 640,\n            });\n            childWindow.loadUrl('file://' + __dirname + '/child.html');\n\n            childWindow.webContents.on('dom-ready', function() {\n                console.log('main.js :: new child window loaded.');\n                childWindow.show();\n            });\n\n            childWindow.on('closed', function() {\n                console.log('main.js :: child window closed');\n                childWindow = null;\n            });\n        }\n    };\n});\n```\n\n**main.html**\n\n``` html\n<html>\n<head>\n    <title>Main window</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <p>\n    Sample text\n    </p>\n    <button onClick=\"openChild()\"> open child window </button>\n\n    <script>\n        var ipc = require('ipc');\n        var chalk = require('chalk');\n\n        function openChild() {\n            console.log('main :: open child button clicked. sending child:open ipc msg to main process');\n            ipc.send('child:open');\n        }\n    </script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n**child.html**\n\n``` html\n<html>\n<head>\n    <title>Child window</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <p>Check console logs.
