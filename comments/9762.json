    "body": "@FaustianSpirit If you want to use electron you don't have to build from source and you definitely don't have to run `npm` from source.\r\n\r\nIf you just use `npm install electron` you will get prebuilt binaries for your OS you can use to develop.  Check out [Electron Quick Start](https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start) for a super simple demo."
