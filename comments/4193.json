    "body": "Hey @zweicoder â€” thanks for digging that up! I work on Nylas N1 and we've had a few requests for this feature. (https://github.com/nylas/N1/issues/408) It definitely seems like that API is the right one. I think that this class (https://github.com/atom/electron/blob/0e2ac2d80226c652042c2f8819b596876119d6bd/atom/browser/browser_linux.cc) needs to implement these functions (currently only implemented on Mac OS X), and then `atom_api_app.cc` needs to be updated to expose them to JavaScript on Linux as well as Mac OS X.\n\n```\n  // Set/Get dock's badge text.\n  void DockSetBadgeText(const std::string& label);\n  std::string DockGetBadgeText();\n```\n"
