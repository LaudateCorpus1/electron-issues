    "body": "The functionality provided in this module overlaps with Node's builtin modules, we can probably extend Node's APIs instead of adding a new module.\n\nFor getting the process memory, I think we can merge the results to `process.memoryUsage()`, or add a new API to `process` object like `process.memoryUsageEx()`. And for getting the system memory, the `os` module already has `os.freemem()` and `os.totalmem()`, we can probably add `os.freeswapmem()` and `os.totalswap()` if you really need them.\n"
