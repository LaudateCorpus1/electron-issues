    "body": "Sorry for not clarifying:\n\nYes, it says \"Hardware accelerated\" on the top of the page but when you look further down on the page in the \"Driver Information\" section you'll notice that Electron is not using the same driver as Chromium and therefore it's actually not using Hardware Acceleration, in-spite of what it says on the top of the page. (It is using the MESA driver which on this system is known to be the software renderer as apposed to Mali which is know to be the hardware renderer). \n\n![2016-08-17_17-21-54](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20197680/17753895/f9e3428a-649f-11e6-95ad-480a9322eec4.png)\n\nJust to clarify, I'm running them both (Chromium and Electron) on the exact same device.\n\nChromium by default was also using the Mesa driver but after adding the command line switches `--ignoregpublacklist` `--numrasterthreads=2`  and `--usegl=egl` It changed to `Video Decode: Hardware accelerated` and  the Mali driver. On Electron it only changed to `Video Decode: Hardware accelerated` but the driver remains the default MESA.\n\nSo evidently, Electron IS in fact receiving those flags and making changes accordingly but not completely and not like it's Chromium standalone counterpart.\n\nThis is an area far beyond my expertise so I don't even know on what level the changes are happening, whether other flags are being overridden or the driver is being rejected or something else.... \n\nRegarding trying it on a Chrome browser, since this is on a Arch Linux, I can only use Chromium. So the attached PDFs include one for Electron and one for Chromium.\n"
