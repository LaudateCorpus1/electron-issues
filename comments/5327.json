This is issue not about moving windows between screens and workspaces, but detecting if there is a window present on the current workspace.\n\nTo summarize: If there is a window present on the current workspace, the file should open in that. Otherwise, a new window should open. No windows should be moved.\n\nI therefore don't believe this should be merged with #1836.\n"

    "body": "@zcbenz Moving the window would not solve the problem. That would still cause both file 1 and file 2 to be open in the same window, which is not wanted/expected. It is expected to have a window with file 1 on workspace A and a window with file 2 on workspace B.\n\nI have a attached a drawing drawing that might clarify this:\n\n![open-window-if-none-exists-on-workspace](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/220658/14936670/e05363f2-0ef2-11e6-815a-8e1b4d78f973.png)\n\nAs shown in this drawing, going from the actual behavior to the expected behavior cannot be done by moving the window. However, a new window needs to be opened on workspace B.\n\nFor the record, the expected behavior can be achieved today from terminal by some manual work by the user:\n- The user opens file 1 on workspace A\n- The user changes to workspace B\n- The user checks if there is an existing window on the current workspace (B) (in the drawing above, the answer would be \"no\")\n- If yes, the user opens file 2 by using the command\n\n```\natom file2\n```\n- If no, the user opens the file by using the command\n\n```\natom --new-window file2\n```\n\nWhat I would like to see is that this process is automated. In other words, that Atom/Electron automatically checks if a window exists on the current workspace and performs the same operation as \"--new-window\" does if there is no window on the current workspace.\n"
