    "body": "Yes I know that I could just transpile code using Babel and output it to some file and later use such a file with Electron. However, for that I would need to run babel command on each file change. And if I don't want to do so I would still need some tool to watch files for changes. So whatever I do I still need some tool. I would like to minimise configuration. I know it's not Electron's fault but React's fault that it's using jsx which on one hand is great but on the other it's frustrating that you have to install so much bloatware to just transpile code. I know that I'm whining a lot :)"
