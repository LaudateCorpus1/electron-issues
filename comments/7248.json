    "body": "That's expected behavior, your menu item has captured the key event and now the dialog view is no longer to respond to the event. It can not be solved with our current API, even if you use Cocoa to write a native app it would still be very nasty to solve.\n\nThe correct way to do this is to handle the arrow keys with DOM events, so it does not mess up with other native components. \n"
