Thanks :smile:\n@enlight Yes I am using Webpack, but even if I only specify the path as `path.join('config.json', 'utf8');`, it still wouldn't work. And yes I knew about the Electron community, Slack is my prefered choice but I haven't used it much, I will try to use the community more often :smile: Thanks for your reply :smile:\n"
