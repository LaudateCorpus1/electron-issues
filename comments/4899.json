    "body": "@hongrich yep, that seems to be it. Confirmed I can do this on 10.11.4:\n- package with `electron-packager@5.2.1`\n- fix `CFBundleExecutable` in the the helper apps:\n  \n  ```\n  /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy \\\n    -c \"set :CFBundleExecutable \\\"$app_name Helper EH\\\"\" \\\n    \"$dist_dir/$app_name.app/Contents/Frameworks/$app_name Helper EH.app/Contents/Info.plist\"\n  /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy \\\n    -c \"set :CFBundleExecutable \\\"$app_name Helper NP\\\"\" \\\n    \"$dist_dir/$app_name.app/Contents/Frameworks/$app_name Helper NP.app/Contents/Info.plist\"\n  ```\n- codesign the top-level bundle with `codesign --force`.\n\nThen I can take the signed app to 10.11.3 and pass `codesign --verify`.\n\nStill unclear to me how 10.11.4 fits into this picture!\n"
