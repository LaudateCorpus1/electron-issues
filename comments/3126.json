I can move the windows out of the screen manually, but how can I would like to do that programatically. I the past I created [BAT](https://github.com/IonicaBizau/bat)–a platform similar to Electron (of course, not so powerful! :joy:). I tried moving the window using `setWindowPosition(-200, -200)` and it alsmot worked, but only vertically (the top side went out of the visible area).\n\n[Here](https://github.com/IonicaBizau/bat/blob/345fb73dad3f3b5eea81d36e4cb6a50b282b4028/source/main.cpp#L186-L197) is the snippet that moves the window. :thought_balloon:\n"
