Here is a video illustrating my situation:\n\nhttp://cl.ly/2F0I1r2b2a13\n1. You can see that before clicking on the \"compose\" tray item, the Explorer window has the focus (as indicated by the \"X\" menu bar button being red).\n2. When the \"compose\" window closes, focus does not revert to the Explorer window.\n\nHere is another video where I hide the main window when the compose window closes, just to be sure, and focus still does not revert to the Explorer window:\n\nhttp://cl.ly/2E1c0R19471J\n"

There are some hints in source code of electron shows below :\n\n``` C\n//atom/browser/native_window.h\nvirtual void Focus(bool focus) = 0;\n\n...\n\n//atom/browser/native_window_views.cc\nvoid NativeWindowViews::Focus(bool focus) {\n  if (focus)\n    window_->Activate();\n  else\n    window_->Deactivate();\n}\n\n...\n\n//description in BrowserWindow API\nwin.focus()\nFocus on the window.\n\n```\n\nBut electron API has not method to set focus false. Maybe we need dive more deeper.\n"
