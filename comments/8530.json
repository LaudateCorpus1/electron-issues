You can tell this by watching the cursor when Dota is in focus. Although you can't see the Electron window, the cursor type changes when I mouse over the location it would be.\r\n* During the focus switch, there's a slight flash of black, but when I recorded with OBS the duration of black was significantly longer.\r\n"
