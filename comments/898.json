    "body": "The `OverrideChildProcessPath` and `OverrideFrameworkBundlePath` actually are overrides of the corresponding methods in brightray, the default behavior was exactly the same with this PR, so you can just remove the overrides.\n\nWe hardcoded the Helper and Framework name because there were users reporting failed to start application when they only renamed `Atom.app`, but I now think it is good not to hardcode them. Can you also add some notes on rebranding application in `docs/tutorial/application-distribution.md` so we can avoid causing confusions?\n"

I had to make a change to Brightray to make this happen, the build will probably fail until that is merged.\n\n> Can you also add some notes on rebranding application\n\nDone. I also mentioned `grunt-build-atom-shell` which solves the node module problem on Windows and automates this a bit. \n"
