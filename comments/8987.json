After attempting to isolate the issue in my app, however, I'm all but certain that it's hitting a memory limit.\r\n\r\nIf I comment out portions of my app, I can eventually make it \"small\" enough that I can successfully take a heap snapshot; the largest snapshot I've been able to take on Electron 1.6.7 is 62.5MB. However, if I uncomment one additional module import in my app and attempt another heap snapshot, DevTools disconnects around 30% with an error similar to @jingman's above.\r\n\r\nIf I downgrade the Electron version of my app from 1.6.7 to 1.3.15 I have no problem taking a heap snapshot. The full snapshot comes back at 82.6MB, which leads me to believe that Electron 1.6.x is crashing DevTools when it hits a memory limit that isn't present in 1.3.15."
