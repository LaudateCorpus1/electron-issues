    "body": "@paulcbetts Yeah, I found that after a second read of the documentation - I'd probably missed it because it's listed under WebContents rather than BrowserWindow. Perhaps a note about `executeJavaScript` should be added under `loadUrl`?\n\nAs it's commonplace to use use `javascript:` URLs in most 'embedded browsers' for injecting JS, I imagine this may be a frequent thing for people to run into.\n\nAside from that, I was alerted by a friend that this bug may point at a deeper potential security issue; its behaviour is very similar to that of IE, when it made the [Universal XSS](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2015/Feb/0) bug possible. This should probably be looked into further, potentially treated as a security issue.\n"
