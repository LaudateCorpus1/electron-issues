    "body": "Applications really should not rely on this setting for detecting the current scale factor.  This is a user preference setting for gnome-shell.  Other desktops can and will use a different schema altogether to store this preference.  The correct place to query the current scale factor is from the X server itself, via some toolkit's api, or using the X11 api directly to read the server xsettings.  This will also prevent you from ending up in normal-dpi mode when 'autodetect' is enabled for that gsettings key (0).\n"
