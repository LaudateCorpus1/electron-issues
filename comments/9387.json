    "body": "Seems like a bug in objects-registry.js\r\n\r\nIt only increases reference count the first time an object is referenced, but this can cause problems with page reload. This sequence of events happened when testing @lneir example:\r\n\r\n- initial load\r\n- hello.js was added to objects-registry and referenced count increased\r\n- reload\r\n- hello.js was added to objects-registry(no reference count increased)\r\n- after a while, garbage collection in renderer process caused the first reference to hello.js to be released\r\n- browser process removes hello.js from object-registry even though it is still being referenced by the second context.\r\n\r\nThis was only noticed in 1.6.8 because of the memory leak fix(previously context were never released)\r\n\r\nPushed #9389 with fix"
