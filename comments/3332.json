The problem i see with the latter approach is that if an accelerator is registered but its mapped numpad accelerator fails to register then should the entire registeration be returned as success or failure ?\n\n``` javascript\nglobalShortcut.register('ctrl+Plus', listener);\nglobalShortcut.register('ctrl+NumpadAdd', listener);\n\n// verify the registrations and take actions in the listener.\n```\n"
