    "body": "I've added the frame as per @dogboy21 , and just like his video, I've confirmed the CSS interaction works when frame:true.  When I do frame:false, it behaves as it does in the video.  \nI have a hamburger menu icon in my main app that toggles an animation when hovered, and in 1.4.1 it works - it's a larger sized icon - but the hover interaction seems to have changed.  It doesn't interact on the whole region, but lower and offset.  Again, it works perfectly in 1.2.6.\n"
