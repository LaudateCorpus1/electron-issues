    "body": "By using hidden browser window atom-shell can actually do what phantomjs does, the example in phantomjs's homepage could be translated to atom-shell:\n\n``` js\nBrowserWindow = require('browser-window');\n\nconsole.log('Loading a web page');\nvar page = new BrowserWindow({show: false});\nvar url = 'http://www.phantomjs.org/';\npage.on('loading-state-changed', (event, isLoading) {\n  if (!isLoading)\n    //Page is loaded!\n    require('app').exit();\n});\npage.loadUrl(url);\n```\n\nOf course we may need to add some more APIs for automation testing purpose.\n\nThe only problem is instead of drawing into a virtual buffer, atom-shell actually draws the page into a real window, this would require a graphic environment, on Window and OS X it doesn't matter, however on Linux we have to use [xvfb](http://www.x.org/archive/X11R7.7/doc/man/man1/Xvfb.1.xhtml) to provide a X server for atom-shell. This is by design in Chromium's content API, so we can not do anything to remove the dependency of graphic environment.\n"

    "body": "I've had success with this lately (using Xvfb on an Ubuntu server). My use-case is capturing screenshots of templated pages. In fact, I've found that atom-shell through Xvfb on the server (an m3-large) has better performance than on my local Macbook pro.  This led me to want to get atom-shell working through Xvfb in osx as well.\n\nSince osx ships with Xvfb, that part is easy. Can I get atom-shell to use an Xvfb display in osx? Using the standard `DISPLAY` env variable like I do in linux is not working. Perhaps libchromiumcontent doesn't know how to use X11 when running in Darwin?\n"

    "body": "I've been given the task to automate user behavior for one of our web applications that will be converted to a stand alone desktop Electron application. Before our company decided to make this move, we created page objects using the chrome web driver and interacted with the web application by invoking buttons/dropdowns/textboxes using the css selectors. Is there a way to do this with a web application that is wrapped with the Electron shell? The company plans on using the menu bar options to invoke certain functionality and I tried to get to the default menu bar options like File/Edit/Help using the JavaScript driver with no success. Are there any examples out there on how to do this?\n"

    "body": "Yeah, but why would you need sugar for what you don't use? (I was referring to all the sugar - you could theoretically re-implement Electron in its entirety with just vanilla Node + OpenGL bindings).\n\nThe most common use case for headless browsers are things like what [mocha-phantomjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mocha-phantomjs-core) and Karma already exist for - running browser unit tests from the CLI. Most people use xvfb, a headless X server, on Travis if they need to test Firefox/Chrome, because that doesn't have a running X server, and you could even run Electron with that, but headless browsers like PhantomJS and SlimerJS don't need an X server. Electron + Nightmare still needs an X server of some kind (even if it's xvfb) to run, and this issue is asking for that dependency to be removed, but it most likely won't happen until [Chromium itself can go headless](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=546953) and those changes propagated to [libchromiumcontent](https://github.com/electron/libchromiumcontent).\n"

I'm not sure how Electron interfaces with/extends Chromium, but it seems to me that the steps to implement this are:\r\n\r\n1. Upgrade Electron's Chromium to version 59+.\r\n2. Supply the `headless` command-line flag/configuration parameter.\r\n3. Other stuff I'm obviously not accounting for. :)\r\n\r\nI guess what I'm saying is, with `headless` now available in Chromium, implementing a headless mode (e.g. for NightmareJS) seems to be relatively straightforward.  Granted, a general-purpose version of Electron might take some time to iron out certain use cases.  However, to generate a build designed for something like NightmareJS, should be pretty straightforward, right?\r\n\r\nIf I had an immediate need for the speed improvements, I'd jump in and take a shot at it.  However, we're still getting by with NightmareJS as-is, so we're ok for the time being.\r\n\r\nRegardless, thanks to the maintainers of all of these projects for their contributions and hard work! :)"
