    "body": "Hey guys, I apologize for the delayed response. So here is some code from our application that we are using to capture the page. This code is running on Windows 10, Linux Mint Debian Edition, non-retina Macs, and retina MacBooks. This is essentially the 3rd scenario from my original post on this issue - _the root issue is still present, but can be managed_. We have just accepted that the captured jpeg on retina displays will have a higher image resolution than expected but we have found that the quality of the image is acceptable. In our case, the application is being used for digital evidence preservation so we opted to keep the raw captured image. However, if you want the resulting image to be the expected dimensions you would resize it down by scaleFactor.\r\n\r\nPlease note that I ripped out the pertinent code from our application and had to sanitize it quite a bit as it is a closed source application. As such, this code as it's copied here is not running exactly as is - it's meant to just show what we're doing.\r\n\r\nThe code is currently running against Electron v1.4.15 in production and v1.6.5 in dev.\r\n\r\n```\r\n// webview is the WebView element in my html page\r\n\r\n// Injects javascript into the webview page in order to determine the viewable window height\r\nfunction getWebviewMeta(cb) {\r\n    var code = \"var r = {}; \\\r\n        r.pageHeight = window.innerHeight; \\\r\n        r.pageWidth = window.innerWidth; \\\r\n        r;\";\r\n    webview.executeJavaScript(code, false, function (r) {\r\n        let webviewMeta = {};\r\n        webviewMeta.captureHeight = r.pageHeight;\r\n        webviewMeta.captureWidth = r.pageWidth;\r\n        cb(webviewMeta);\r\n    });\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Creates an image of the visible area of the WebView\r\nfunction captureWeb() {\r\n    getWebviewMeta(function (webviewMeta) {\r\n\r\n        // builds a rectangle whose dimensions are scaled based on the display scale factor\r\n        // this rectangle represents the scaled viewable window in the Electron application for the WebView\r\n        let captureRect = {\r\n            x: 0,\r\n            y: 0,\r\n            width: +webviewMeta.captureWidth * electron.screen.getPrimaryDisplay().scaleFactor,\r\n            height: +webviewMeta.captureHeight * electron.screen.getPrimaryDisplay().scaleFactor\r\n        };\r\n\r\n        webview.capturePage(captureRect, (img) => {\r\n            if (img.isEmpty()) {\r\n                // DIDN’T CAPTURE\r\n                // NOTE - in my application we are manually scrolling the view and timing of the record\r\n                // is an issue - sometimes the captured image is empty, we delay a few hundred ms\r\n                // and capture again\r\n            } else {\r\n                // SAVE YOUR JPEG FILE\r\n                let jpgFile = img.toJPEG(90);\r\n\r\n                // If you want the image size to be the expected pixel resolution, resize it by scaleFactor:\r\n                let resizedImg = img.resize({width : img.getSize().width / electron.screen.getPrimaryDisplay().scaleFactor});\r\n                let resizedJpgFile = resizedImg.toJPEG(90);\r\n            }\r\n        });\r\n    });\r\n}\r\n```"
