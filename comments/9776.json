    "body": "We have the same behavior our app is doing a lot of ajax requests and even usiing webviews all the cookies are saved in devtools cookies under file:/// after we restart the app and check again the devtools / cookies under file:/// there is nothing, if we open the same webview that we used before to login into a website, it says we are not logged in because there are no cookies. Even mainWindow.webContents.session.cookies.get is returning an empty array. Any suggestion?\r\n\r\nThanks"
