I think it comes down to usability vs file size, on my CI builds downloading electron releases takes maybe 3 seconds whereas building takes 8-10 minutes.\n\nNot saying I wouldn't appreciate having a smaller `.electron` folder but I don't see this as great usability choice or a massive improvement (these file sizes only affect developers).\n\n**IMO**\n"

But since there is 1.39 GB file in the artifacts, maybe electron team will don't mind to distribute in 7z as well. Because it is just several lines in the publish script.\n"
