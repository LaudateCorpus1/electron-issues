    "body": "@deepak1556 Can we better document the behavior of `onbeforeunload` in the [docs](http://electron.atom.io/docs/api/browser-window/)? Unlike what the originator of #2579 wanted to claim, I can't find anywhere mentioning that the behavior is different from what browsers usually do (e.g. show a dialog, but they are inconsistent anyway), and hence I went on to read the [spec](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/787bc8570382e98c4f204abff05b2af122e5a422/spec/api-browser-window-spec.js), but then they aren't indicative (say nowhere mentions the conversion-to-string you described).\n"

You can find more info about how blink handles webIdl types [here](https://www.chromium.org/blink/webidl). Specifically look at the `undefined and null` section.\n"
