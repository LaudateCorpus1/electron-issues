    "body": "I use electron 1.4.15.\r\n\r\nAs I understand it, this behaviour is not a bug, this is what is intended.\r\nIn the documentation it's said that for app.makeSingleInstance:\r\n\r\n> On macOS the system enforces single instance automatically when users try to open a second instance of your app in Finder, and the open-file and open-url events will be emitted for that. However when users start your app in command line the system’s single instance mechanism will be bypassed and you have to use this method to ensure single instance.\r\n\r\nMy issue is more about triggering another event, much like open-url or open-file, that would give notice that the user has tried opening another instance of the app."
