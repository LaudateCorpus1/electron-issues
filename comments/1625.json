    "body": "@paulcbetts Indeed - I have an issue that I think might be related. Using either setPosition or the new setBounds API the position is set on the _currently focused_ screen rather than being fixed. Ie:\n- Click to focus some other application on screen 1\n- setPosition(100,100)\n- Click to focus some other application on screen 2\n- setPosition(100,100)\n\nThe window will move to two different locations. I can split this out into a separate issue if needed.\n"
