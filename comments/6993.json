    "body": "@enlight @MarshallOfSound I filed this as upstream issue because a native menu typically handles trimming of long entries by itself. For example on Mac I see the \"...\" being inserted in the middle:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/900690/17999450/a2e69bcc-6b79-11e6-8feb-3ea298dbe84c.png)\n\nMy understanding is that the menu in Electron on Windows is a custom Chrome one and not the native menu. I think what I really wanted to express is that it would be good to have the native Windows menu working for Electron eventually because there are many known issues and challenges with the current one.\n\nAs for the reported issue: I have no control over the ellipsis in the menu so I cannot even do the ellipsis myself because I have no information about the valid length until the \"...\" is being added. In some cases I would probably end up with my own ellipsis in the middle and the one added from the windows menu.\n\nDoes this make more sense now?\n"

Did they use the [CRecentDocumentList from WTL](https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/third_party/wtl/include/atlmisc.h?rcl=0&l=3209) which compacts filenames to `MAX_PATH` (260) characters before inserting them into the menu?\n"

    "body": "> My understanding is that the menu in Electron on Windows is a custom Chrome one and not the native menu. I think what I really wanted to express is that it would be good to have the native Windows menu working for Electron eventually because there are many known issues and challenges with the current one.\n\nSwitching to native menu doesn't help on this, as far as I know neither win32 menu nor GTK menu supports controlling the position of ellipses, and it would actually lead us to a custom menu.\n\n> As for the reported issue: I have no control over the ellipsis in the menu so I cannot even do the ellipsis myself because I have no information about the valid length until the \"...\" is being added. In some cases I would probably end up with my own ellipsis in the middle and the one added from the windows menu.\n\nIt is possible to control the behavior of ellipsis with Chromium's UI framework, but it would quite tricky since we are just reusing Chromium's code to create the menu.\n"
