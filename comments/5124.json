I'm sorry I should have test it on more machines, I tested on two machines I had access to at office in addition of my laptop (all win 10) and they all had this issue but after your last comment I doubt  again it may be just me and because of something in my environment (these machines all have pretty much the same env set up) so I tried it yet on another computer (win 10 again) and it seems like it's working just fine! I don't know what is the issue in those other systems but whatever it is it can't be related to Electron.\nMy apology again, let me close the ticket, I really appreciate your time and your help.\n,m\n"
