For windows build, Squirrel.Windows will decide automatically if there is an update based on the RELEASES file it downloads, it will make a comparison with the RELEASES file that you already have with the installed app. That means that when checking for updates you have to send the RELEASES file to the electron app.\n2. When the RELEASES file have a newer version than that installed by the user it will automatically request the newest .nupkg found in the RELEASES file (it could be the full version or the delta version).\n\nHope it helps\n"
