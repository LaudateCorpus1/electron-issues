In this specific case I had a typo in one of my require statements in main.js, but I've also been able to reproduce it by syntax errors in modules required within main.js.  I found the problems by running the modules outside of atom-shell.  Once I fixed the mistakes, the program launched fine.\n\nI've tried detecting it with `process.on('error', ...`, `'process.on('uncaughtException', ...` and using the included crash-reporter.

    "body": "+1 This is a bug - an incorrect require statement isn't really the same as an invalid app, which makes this error deceptive at best.\n\nThe attached commit seems to just manually detect when a module isn't found and then still throw the same error, regardless. Is there something I'm missing? It seems like what you want to detect is if one of the key modules is missing (ie main.js), but this looks to report the same error regardless of which require statement goes wrong.\n\nAbsent of a more in-depth solution, could the error message be modified to mention require statements in some way?  This can be a pain in the neck to debug if you don't already know that a script error can trigger this. \n"
