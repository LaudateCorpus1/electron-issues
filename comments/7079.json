As a result it was never recommended to use this for accuracy sensitive jobs as they were never designed to be an accurate timer since they were subject to interrupts.\r\n\r\nSo when someone says it isn't working right in the render or main. There could be things to improve it but never fix it outright. This would involve redesigning timers completely."
