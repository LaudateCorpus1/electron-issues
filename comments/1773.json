The bug only occurs when launching from the icon or Spotlight.\n\nUsing OSX 10.9.5 and Electron 0.28.2\n"

    "body": "I'm not sure if this is the same issue, but I've been trying to figure out why the emoji picker on OS X is often positioned incorrectly inside a `<webview>` and it seems related. What I've found is that the host html page must be focused first (clicking works), then the webview's page must be focused, and _then_ it will position correctly.\n\nHere's a recording of the behavior. The `<webview>` has a red background. Each page's background is yellow while the mouse is down.\n\n![focus](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5355/12870231/0b6d6cf8-cd09-11e5-8d31-f99cb0b3c1e2.gif)\n\nTested on OS X 10.11.3 with Electron 0.36.7 using this code:  https://gist.github.com/javan/be0bfcfe237f7583d2e4\n\nAs an aside, I noticed adding `autofocus` to the input element in the `<webview>` has no effect. The input is not focused when loaded.\n\nIn some ways, my issue sounds similar to https://github.com/atom/electron/issues/382:\n\n> The window is focused but I cannot trap keyboard press using mousetrap until I make a click on the web view inside the window.\n"
