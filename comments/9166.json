    "body": "This would be pretty great for Slack, considering our current team-switching approach is basically a stack of `webview` tags (and resizing them on the fly, which often results in layout jitter). If there is z-index support that would be :gem:. A few questions:\r\n\r\n* Will we be able to disable `nodeintegration` in the same manner as the `webview`?\r\n* Would there be any other security loopholes opened by using this instead of `webview`s?"

    "body": "@CharlieHess Yeah, `new BrowserView({ webPreferences: { nodeintegration: false }})` works fine. This should be fine for remote content, but please wait until the experimental tag has been removed before using it for that purpose.\r\n\r\nBtw. I just added autoresizing support for smooth resizing!"
