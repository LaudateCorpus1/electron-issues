    "body": "What quick start instructions are you using?\n\nHave you tried running `npm start` in the quick start app directory? The quick start instructions right now say to run `npm start` in the directory, rather than `electron .`\n\nAs you mentioned, running `electron` in the command line won't work because `npm install` installs all dependencies locally in the app directory, instead of globally. The quick start app includes the `npm start` script so you can run the app using the local dependency, without having to set up `electron` globally.\n\nHope that helps!\n"

    "body": "@mnquintana Yes, I've tried that. The getting started tutorial tells you to use `electron .`, which doesn't work, but the example hello world app instruction, which you can clone from the repo, tells you to use the `npm install && npm start`, which is why I even tried that in my tutorial app (thinking: \"Maybe it'll work if I don't do what they tell me here, but what worked for the other app?\"). That resulted in the longer error I described above.\nWhat I was also wondering about is, that the tutorial doesn't tell you to list the electron as a dependency in your `package.json` although it clearly is one. I had to figure that out myself as well. Still no run : (\n\nI also linked the example app and the getting started tutorial in my first post.\n\nWhy did you close the topic? The issue is not resolved.\n"

Since you installed locally, you should run the latter command, which should work if you've run `npm install` in your project directory.\n\nTo make things easier, I'd recommend looking into [setting up an `npm run` script](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts) so you don't have to type the full path to the Electron binary every time you run your app.\n"

You can also put them in separate files and require them here.\n```\n\nNext to the line 35 would be:\n\n```\n    app.on('window-all-closed', function () {\n  // On OS X it is common for applications and their menu bar\n  // to stay active until the user quits explicitly with Cmd + Q\n  if (process.platform !== 'darwin') {\n    app.quit()\n  }\n})\n```\n\nHowever, `app` is defined at the top:\n\n```\nconst app = electron.app\n```\n\nSo I don't know what is going on : /\n"
