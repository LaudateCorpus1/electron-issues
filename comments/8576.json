    "body": "Hi @stephennyu ,\r\n\r\nI would like to direct you towards some support options for using electron.\r\n\r\nYour best bet is to engage the community as follows:\r\n\r\n- if you have a general usage question, there are several options\r\n  - join our [atom slack](http://atom-slack.herokuapp.com/) and ask in the #electron channel\r\n  - stack overflow has an [electron tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/electron) you can use\r\n\r\nThan you!"
