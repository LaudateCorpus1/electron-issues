    "body": "Ok, I installed Atom to test. And... It worked. The main difference was in the `atom.desktop` file where the Icon part was not a full path, but just the name of the application.\nSo I think I narrowed down the problem to my desktop environment.\nApparently the problem comes from the `.desktop` file. Maybe Cinnamon (my desktop environment) doesn't like absolute path for the Icon. If I replace the path by respectively `rocketchat` and `boostnote` the icons are displayed on launch.\nAnyway, thanks!\n"
