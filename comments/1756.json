    "body": "Sending big data through IPC is always slow and would block your app for some time, if we serialize `Buffer` when sending it the app's whole performance would be decreased as long as there is a `Buffer` in some objects being sent.\n\nA possible solution is to use shared memory for sending `Buffer`s, but I don't think it deserves the effort, because under most cases when you want to send a `Buffer` you are doing the wrong thing.\n"

    "body": "Hi, \n\nI understand your point.\n\nHowever \"Buffer\" does not always mean big data, it just means binary data.\n\nIn my case for example, the size is usually between **10 and 100 bytes**. That's a very small size, still, performing random byte access is slow, so I have to rely on a deprecated feature (`.toString('binary')`) to achieve that properly.\n"
