    "body": "> Change show/hide events on macOS to behave like they do on Windows/Linux. This could be considered a breaking change.\r\n\r\nI'm okay changing this in Electron 2.0 but I don't think we should change it beforehand.\r\n\r\n> Implement occluded/unoccluded events and isOccluded() for macOS. These can be left undocumented if we so wish.\r\n\r\nThis seems useful and maybe we can eventually get it supported on other platforms.\r\n\r\n> Change document.hidden and document.visibilityState to be driven by the new occlusion events/method on macOS.\r\n\r\nThis sounds good to me as well, but I'm interpreting this a non-breaking change that just makes these values more correct on macOS."
