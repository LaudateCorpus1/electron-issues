    "body": "Thanks @erkyrath. \n\n---\n\nOk, there's definitely something wrong here. First, let's look at what the docs say about the `open-file` event:\n\n> Emitted when the user wants to open a file with the application. The open-file event is usually emitted when the application is already open and the OS wants to reuse the application to open the file. open-file is also emitted when a file is dropped onto the dock and the application is not yet running. Make sure to listen for the open-file event very early in your application startup to handle this case (even before the ready event is emitted).\n\nHere are my findings (using `will-finish-launching` by the way): \n\n# No plist changes\n\n## Finder\n\n#### Not running\n\nI can drop any type of file on the app in finder: the app icon will show a gray background behind it, it will open the app, and emit the `open-file` event. \n\n#### Already running\n\nDropping the file on the app in finder when the app is already running results in the app coming to the front but the `open-file` event is not emitted.\n\n## Dock\n\n#### Not running\n\nNothing happens.\n\n#### Already running\n\nNothing happens. No visual change to the icon. The app is not brought to the front.\n\n## Open with...\n\nI.e. right clicking a file, clicking Open With, then Other, navigating to the directory where the app is.\n\n#### Not running\n\nThe app is shown as a \"Recommended Application\" (not gray). Selecting the app will open it and then emit `open-file`.\n\n#### Already running\n\nThe app is shown as a \"Recommended Application\" (not gray). Selecting the app will bring the appto the front but `open-file` won't be emitted.\n\n# With plist changes\n\nI've used @erkyrath's electron-packager fork to achieve this.

    "body": "I am also encountering similar behavior to @adam-lynch on macOS Sierra, where the `open-file` event is simply not being delivered.  Can we please re-open?\r\n\r\nI have an application that calls `app.makeSingleInstance` and registers an `open-file` event handler.  I'm using [electron-builder](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder), and have a [file association](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder) for CSV files that I've verified results in the appropriate entries in `Info.plist`.\r\n\r\nI am primarily interested in being able to open CSV files with my via \"Open With...\" from the Context menu in the Finder. What I find happens is this:\r\n\r\n- If my application is not running, it is started and the `open-file` event for the selected file is delivered to the application, as I would expect.  This, combined with visual inspection of the Info.plist file (and comparison to the corresponding entries in Info.plist for `.csv` file handling in Atom), leads me to believe that the file association information in `Info.plist` is correct.\r\n\r\n- If there is already an instance of the application running, the callback for `makeSingleInstance` in the running app will be invoked, but **the `open-file` event is not delivered to the running instance of the application.**.  The `argv` passed to the `makeSingleInstance` callback invocation seems odd and not very useful; it is something like:\r\n```\r\n[ '/Volumes/Tad 0.6.6/Tad.app/Contents/MacOS/Tad',\r\n  '-psn_0_1503599' ]\r\n```\r\nI have no idea what's going on with `argv[1]` (`-psn_0_...`) there.\r\n\r\nThe rationale @zcbenz gave for closing this was \"works for Atom...must be the user's fault\", which seemed a bit premature to me. \r\nQuick question:  Does Atom use `app.makeSingleInstance`?  From my (very cursory) reading of the Atom source it looks to me like maybe it has its own socket-based mechanism that it uses instead.  I think the issue here is the interaction of `open-file` with `makeSingleInstance`.\r\n\r\nThe really painful part about issues like this is that, as far as I know, one has to build and install a fully packaged app to actually test (which for me takes about 5 to 10 min), and it's much more difficult to see what's going on in a packaged app than an unpackaged dev one.  If there is interest and willingness to re-open I'm willing to try to put together a minimal reproducible example."
