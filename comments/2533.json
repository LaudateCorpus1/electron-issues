    "body": "@OlsonDev thanks so much for the feedback on this. In the future it might be more helpful to comment on lines from the `Files Changed` tab in the pull request versus the individual commits.\n\nThat way it is easier to associate the comments with the lines they are referring to. Below is a screenshot of how it currently looks when commenting on individual commits. It can be a little confusing as to what they refer to since they are attached to the commits instead of individual lines in the diff.\n\n<img width=\"811\" alt=\"screen shot 2015-08-20 at 9 36 05 am\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/671378/9389282/09b55d6e-471f-11e5-8c13-1553326bcea2.png\">\n"
