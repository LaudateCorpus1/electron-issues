    "body": "This patch consists in saving the original file extension and applying it at the end of the temporary file. I’d like to have some feedback on whether _replacing_ the `.tmp` extension instead of appending a new one is preferred.\n\nAlso, I don’t like the fact and modifying the public interface of `ScopedTemporaryFile` by adding the `ext` argument, but couldn’t figure out another way of accomplishing this. Do you have any other ideas?\n\nI’ve tested the patch in both Windows 10 and OS X 10.11 (to make sure there were no regressions on the original `asar` extracting behaviour on a non Windows platform), where the lint produces no warnings and all tests passes (except for two `process.noAsar` related tests that already fail on master on Windows, which are a subject for another PR).\n\nI also made sure the fix behaves correctly in cases where the user wants to extract a file without extension. In this case `Extension()` returns an empty string and `AddExtension()` returns the original file path if so, therefore there are no regressions in this case.\n"
