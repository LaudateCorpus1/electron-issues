    "body": "When I install `runas` via the #2 method described in 'using native node modules' (setting a variety of environment variables before calling npm install), it loads fine.\n\nLooking at those instructions further, I tried added a --runtime=electron flag to the node-gyp command line for my module. That appeared to change the error case somewhat. electron now seems to just exit immediately, silently, with code 0. However, debugging over RDP is tiresome and slow, so I will have to report back tomorrow.\n\nI will note that using the download version of runas with my debug version of electron still results in the same dll error, so maybe the issue there is a mismatch between Release version of a module and Debug build of electron? Regardless, I still didn't seem able to make electron-prebuilt run correctly with my locally built new module. It seems to just exit immediately.\n"
