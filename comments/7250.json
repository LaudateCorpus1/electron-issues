    "body": "As I can see, there is no way currently to turn a bitmap buffer into a `NativeImage` object as it only tries to decode PNG or JPEG buffers in `createFromBuffer`.\n\nWe could extend the capabilities of `nativeImage.createFromBuffer` to handle bitmap buffers, or add a different method like `createFromBitmap` to `NativeImage`. In the future frame subscription will emit a `NativeImage` object by default (maybe we could make it optionally available sooner) though.\n\nMaybe you could use offscreen rendering, because that emits `NativeImage` objects by default and much better performance-wise, especially if you want to create video from it.\n"

    "body": "Using offscreen rendering did indeed satisfy my requirements. I'm able to pipe the frames to `ffmpeg` and it works great.\n\nI noticed a couple things however: using `image.toPNG` is much more expensive than `image.toJPEG`.\n\nAlso it seems `image.getBitmap` is definitely the fastest but I was unable to figure out a way to get that buffer into `ffmpeg` happily.\n\nI know that they are 32bit BGRA but setting `pix_fmt=bgra` didn't work. \n"
