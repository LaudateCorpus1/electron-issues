    "body": "@PhilAndrew I'm not an electron maintainer, nor officially affiliated with that project. However, since you reached me directly, and since I'm interested in the matter, I'll give my 2 cents\n\nThis is probably doable and you can probably get it done with a solid bounty. The large issue I see with that is the way Electron apps are structured/entered in, and that's a central JS entry point. \nElectron is more of a \"shell\" that can control all the desktop APIs, rather than a pure web renderer.\nTherefore this would require new mode/paradigm.\n\nI'd suggest looking for something more specific for the purpose - see [Coherent GT ](https://www.coherent-labs.com/product-coherent-gt/) and Coherent UI - both commercial, I'm not directly affiliated with them either, but I know they're very good in performance. Possible drawbacks are incompatibilities/lack of APIs to WebKit, and lack of Node.js integration like Electron. But they are built _specifically for games, specifically with performance in mind, specifically to render in texture_.\n"
