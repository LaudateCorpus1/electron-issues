Under this circumstance, you're in the context of a sandboxed browser environment so that file path is a virtual one (read-only) to the real file and your JS code can open and process it as required.\n\nIf you want the real file path then as @paulcbetts mentions above, you would use the \"dialog module\" and you'll get exactly what you want.\n\nThe reason I raised this issue is because although our app is an Electron app, it loads standard html pages which make use of this tag and when running them under Electron, they would suddenly lose this feature.\n"
