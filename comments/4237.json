    "body": "The `-webkit-app-region` attribute doesn't work very well with complex CSS rules, and I can reproduce the same thing in Chrome extension. I suggest making an Chrome app that can reproduce this problem, and then report it to [Chromium's issues list](https://crbug.com).\n\nI'm closing this since it is a bug of Chromium/blink, and we are not able to fix it on Electron's side.\n"
