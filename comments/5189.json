    "body": "@rgetValue That won't work because it only changes the value in javascript. \n\nHowever I did a quick look around in the docs and I couldn't find an option to change the icon once the browserWindow is created. The only thing that you can use if you are developing for OS X is [`app.dock.setIcon(image)`](http://electron.atom.io/docs/v0.37.6/api/app/#appdockseticonimage-os-x). This will change the dock icon instead of the browserWindow icon.  \n\nJust as a side-note: You should properly not change the icon because it can confuse your users. \n"
