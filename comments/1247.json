    "body": "If you don't pass any parameters to `atom` you see it the default_app in action on the \"Welcome to Atom-Shell\" window.\nAtom-shell always runs the app in `resources/default_app`. The \"default\" default_app does\n- load the app in `resources/app` or `resources/app.asar` if there is one of these\n- load the app specified as a command line arg unless there are no cli args\n- if no app is found, then show \"itself\"\n- it also catches errors and displays a nonsense \"not a valid atom-shell app\" msg instead.\n  (Maybe it does more or the order is slightly off, haven't looked at it in a while. It's tiny, have a look at it if you're interested.)\n\nWhat I did was replacing the contents of `PATH/TO/ATOM-SHELL/resources/default_app` with your app, so errors are thrown (and not catched by the original default_app). Then you have to run atom-shell from the command line (`./atom`) to see the log output.\n"
