I'm using an interval timer of 250ms to read the clipboard and compare it to the last value; if it has changed I send an IPC message to the main Node Electron process, which decides if it's relevant and if it is then sends an IPC message to the visible UI window to update the display. It suits my needs and is very responsive, as soon as I copy text in another application it immediately appears in my Electron app. I don't have access to a Mac so I've only tested this on linux."
