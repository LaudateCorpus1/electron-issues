    "body": "Single executable isn't possible (**edit:** AFAIK) because several ~~dll's~~libraries, content_shell.pak and icudtl.dat need to be distributed with the executable.\nYou can fake it (on Windows) with an app like [Enigma VirtualBox](http://enigmaprotector.com/en/aboutvb.html). This way you create a virtual filesystem inside a container exe. I wouldn't recommend it though, increased memory consumption for each `atom.exe` process.\n**edit:** I'm assuming with 'Atom' you meant 'Atom-Shell' in this case.\n"
