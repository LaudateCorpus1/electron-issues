Mac OS X pick somethings to open mailto:// links when you delete N1, but it's not clear how.\n\nI submitted a PR that implements \"removeAsDefaultProtocolClient\" to mean \"set the default to the first available handler which is not the users app.\" I  did a bit of testing with mailto, and it seems like `LSCopyAllHandlersForURLScheme` always returns Apple Mail.app first, so I'm hopeful that this will behave as people expect. ðŸ˜• \n"
