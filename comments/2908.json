    "body": "@johnmuhl , thanks for comment. I really appreciated your help. I've adjusted my code to be:\n\n`mainWindow.loadUrl('http://whatsmyuseragent.com/',{ userAgent: \"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/41.0.2228.0 Safari/537.36\"});`\n\nIt shows the correct useragent in testing, but the app still doesn't load unless I emulate a different user string from the web inspector. It's really strange, but probably something on my end that's unrelated to electron.\n\n_Update:_ I have it working. The code above worked (it's what John suggested), and I was able to track down an additional error on my server (unrelated to Electron). Thanks for you help!\n"
