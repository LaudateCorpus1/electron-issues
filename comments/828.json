From that, I'm guessing this means I still won't be able to access the data visible in DevTools from within my app. In my case, if I want to access the network data, would I have to write my own local HTTP proxy and then make all the traffic pass through it using the Chrome commandline option?\n\nIn any case, thanks for the quick response.\n"
