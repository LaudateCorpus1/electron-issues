The point I was making is that if you have access to the WebView element then by definition you can create a renderer process with `nodeIntegration` enabled.  This would be very bad if a renderer process without `nodeIntegration` could create itself a new renderer process with `nodeIntegration` enabled.\r\n\r\nAs such it is only safe for processes with `nodeIntegration` already enabled to create WebView's.\r\n\r\n> having nodeIntegration improves security when those features are present\r\n\r\nHaving `nodeIntegration` doesn't improve security technically, having more node API's is **less** secure so it is only allowed when the parent renderer process also has `nodeIntegration`.  This grid might explain it a bit better.\r\n\r\n| Parent Renderer `nodeIntegration` | Can use Node API's | Can use WebView | Can use Node API's through WebView |\r\n|------------------------------------|--------------------|---|---|\r\n| Enabled | Yes | Yes | Yes |\r\n| Disabled | No | No | No |\r\n\r\nYou should be able to see that having a row in that table `\"Disabled | No | Yes | Yes\"` would be ridiculously unsafe"

Since the subordinate has privilege X, the superordinate must clearly indicate and expose its privilege X so as not to mask the existence of that privilege in the subordinate.\r\n\r\nHowever, I think the row I would expect is `\"Disabled | No | Yes | No\"`.  In fact, I think that's the **only** row I would expect.  A more flexible option would be to prevent nodeIntegration in a WebView whose parent does not also have nodeIntegration.  In the current state, we're prevented from the most restrictive option of ensuring nodeIntegration is disabled in the parent BrowserWindow as well as the child WebView."

That kind of power should not be given out lightly.  Imagine a random website X being rendered in Electron just throwing up a webview for the google sign in screen but injecting JS to capture the password.  Entirely possible if they access to the webview element.  The current model is safe and I don't think it should change."

Having a webview gives a renderer access to node APIs through a preload script on that webview.  If an existing renderer has node disabled giving it access to a webview allows it to bypass the disabling of node.  This is neither safe nor secure, hence only renderers with node enabled can use webviews"
