    "body": "yes,I checked the resources/app directory, all modules I needs is exist. After doing  some experiments, I found that if you push the node_modules's path of you develop directory to  module.paths it works perfectly, or (I mean the default node_modules in resource/app/node_modules) it fail. I use electron-packager ,so I guess something wrong when electron-packager copy the node_modules from my develop directory. If I download the template and copy my node_module to resources manually it works fine, so I think it's the issue of electron-packager not the electron itself. Thank you!!!!\n"
