Even though the crash is happening without any atom-shell code on the stack, it's still possible that atom-shell is the original cause of corruption. Tools like GuardMalloc and MallocScribble can help track down where the corruption is happening. https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/performance/conceptual/managingmemory/articles/MallocDebug.html describes how to use these tools.\n"
