It has even been reported that, in some situations, 32-bit Linux® binaries perform better on FreeBSD than they do on Linux®.\n> \n> However, some Linux®-specific operating system features are not supported under FreeBSD. For example, Linux® binaries will not work on FreeBSD if they overly use i386™ specific calls, such as enabling virtual 8086 mode. In addition, 64-bit Linux® binaries are not supported at this time.  \n\nhttps://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/linuxemu.html\n\nPerforms better than on Linux  :smile: \n"

    "body": "@paulcbetts : regarding running linux binaries on FreeBSD, short answer, it _could_ be done using \"linuxulator\" (as pointed out by @s-a).\nRunning FreeBSD, you may install centos6 or fedora10-based linux libraries, that may be used running linux binaries. One of the most common use case being flash plugins.\n\nAs far as I've seen, you need to run linux32 binaries (64 are not recognized in their latest 10.3-RELEASE, whereas 32 bits have been working fine in the last 10 years).\nHaving used nw.js by the past, I ended up with missing libraries - libgconf2, which is there (native) for FreeBSD, but has no equivalent running linux binaries. And I suspect gconf is only the tip of the iceberg. If anything, I'ld strongly recommend to build something native. Otherwise, you'll probably need to build additional ports shipping missing libraries, ...\n\nAnyway, good luck figuring this out.\n"
