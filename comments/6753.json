    "body": "@MarshallOfSound  Thank you very much for your reply. I'm pretty sure I've tried  handler.webContents.send.apply(handler.webContents, args); but it failed for a different reason (I don't have my laptop with me, will update by tomorrow). \nI don't have strong reason to unpack parameter here this way. It's simply because it looks better to me comparing to using argument array :-) (I used to use this way a lot with other script language, like python).\n"
