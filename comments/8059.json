    "body": "Electron does not handle the rendering, it is handled by blink same engine for chrome. The current behavior is consistent with chrome. Loading the image as a top level content will honor the exif value, but not in `<img>` currently. In Electron you can test it out with `window.loadURL`. There is work in standards for fixing this problem. Closing this out, since there is nothing we can do to fix it.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=25508 \r\nhttps://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=158753"
