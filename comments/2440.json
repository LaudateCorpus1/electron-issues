The issue shows up randomly when resetting the structure like that. When this happens I can even get the menu structure and print it to see that it is what I was setting, just the UI is showing bogus things (lost entries or duplicate entries).\n\nAtom might not show this issue because it sits on a very old electron version :)\n"
