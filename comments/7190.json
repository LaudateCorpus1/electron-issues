    "body": "Looked into this a bit, I think the bookmark type is not as widely supported on Windows as it is on macOS.\n\nI think the best thing to do in `electron-context-menu` is to use `clipboard.write` instead and write text and a bookmark at the same time for the `Copy Link` action:\n\n``` js\nclipboard.write({\n  text: 'http://birthday.pizza',\n  bookmark: 'a website'\n})\n```\n\nThe above snippet seems to work correctly on macOS and Windows, you can still access the bookmark with `clipboard.readBookmark()` but apps not supporting bookmarks can still fallback to text support.\n\nUpdating this issue to update the docs to make this clearer.\n"
