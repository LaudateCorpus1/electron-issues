    "body": "Good catch - the correct answer here is that environments with disabled node-integration shouldn't be able to open new windows that do have Node integration, meaning that `openExternal` should not be available in a hostile/non-friendly environment, together with all other Node APIs.\n\nI know that @kevinsawicki did some work around that, so if we have new windows locked down, we could close this issue.\n"
