You're basically getting an error from `git` when trying to check out the submodules, which indicates a problem in your main electron checkout.\r\n\r\nSince you've checked out `master`, you may have gotten a revision which doesn't have correct submodule mapping. Please try building from a tagged revision first, e.g. [v1.6.1](https://github.com/electron/electron/tree/v1.6.1).\r\n\r\nIf that doesn't work...\r\n\r\n1. Have you done a clean checkout of electron, or do you have some local changes?\r\n2. I personally have never used Cygwin to build Electron, so I suggest you stick to `cmd.exe`. Also make sure you have the latest version of Git.\r\n3. There might be something in your environment interfering with the build script. Please try these basic steps first:\r\n  - Open new command prompt and type `set`. Check the output for sensitive information, remove it, and share the rest here (let us know if you _have_ removed something).\r\n  - `cd` into an empty directory and clone the repo again: `git clone https://github.com/electron/electron.git`\r\n  - Type `cd electron` and then `git submodule update --init --recursive`. What's the output?\r\n4. I noticed you have a non-English version of Windows. If all else fails, you could try to temporarily set your locale to en-US and see if it helps.\r\n"

Basically, you will end up with mismatched submodules. One easy fix is to run deinit on all modules and then run the bootstrap script once more.\r\n\r\n`git submodule deinit -f --all`\r\n\r\nOr just remove the electron repo and clone the master branch once more.\r\n\r\nI have tried building directly from master, so the submodules are correctly mapped."
