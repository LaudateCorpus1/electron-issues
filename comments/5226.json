In the second one you can see GNOME Files in the foreground and VS Code in the background; also, to make it clearer I have clicked in the activity menu so it is also displayed. As you can see, the most part of the VS Code interface continues in front of everything. Even if you close the application a black rectangle will the there and will only disappear if you go to the activities screen.\n\nThere was an error in my description: only the title bar behaves correctly, the menu is also there even in the background.\n\nAs I said before, this happens also with Atom Editor, and it seems that it would happen with every app that uses a similar use of Electron.\n\n![foreground](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12746147/14732809/4968a01e-085e-11e6-8316-b285e32a4455.png)\n\n![background](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12746147/14732811/4e7b74be-085e-11e6-92b4-06288062cebd.png)\n"

I thought that I had ruled all the other possibilities before reporting the error, but finally it is related to Chromium 3D rendering inside Gnome 3.20 in my installation (specifically, I think the culprit is the display card driver). Disabling 3D rendering in Chromium works as a workaround. If I could disable it for Electron based applications I could use them until a fix is provided.\n\nYou can close the issue.\n\nBest regards.\n"
