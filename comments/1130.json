    "body": "OK, have have a sort of solution/workaround that allows you to do this.\r\nThis probably has issues (probably including security problems), however in my use case everything is fine & as I am only loading local files I am not to bothered about security.\r\nBasically, unpack the electron.asar file using `asar e electron.asar electron`, hop in to the electron/renderer directory & edit the init.js file.\r\nFind where is says `require('./web-view/web-view')` & in the if statement it is contained within remove ` && process.guestInstanceId == null`, then pack it back up using `asar p electron electron.asar` & delete the electron directory.\r\nThis allows you to use webviews within other webviews, however as I said this may have issues that I have just not encountered yet so you probably shouldn't use it in a production application without looking in to it further yourself.\r\n\r\nI have attached my packed version of this if you would like to use it (it was from release 1.6.2).\r\n[electron.asar.zip](https://github.com/electron/electron/files/888259/electron.asar.zip)\r\n\r\nHope this helps,\r\nJacob"
