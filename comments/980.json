You may want to make your program into multiple DLLs. For more information on the program executable (PE), see the article \"Peering Inside the PE: A Tour of the Win32 Portable Executable File Format\" in the MSDN Library.\n\nSee also:  https://software.intel.com/en-us/forums/topic/280002\n\n\"Steve Lionel (Intel)  Wed, 01/25/2012 - 08:03\nIt is a problem. Windows limits static code and data to 2GB, and you have exceeded this. Even on 64-bit Windows, no matter how much memory you have, the 2GB limit for static (non-allocatable) data remains.\n\nThe solution is to change the arrays from being declared with fixed bounds to being allocatable, and then using ALLOCATE to make them the desired size. If you are on a 64-bit system, this will allow you to have larger arrays. But if you are on a 32-bit system, you cannot go larger than 2GB.\"\n\nFrom https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!topic/chromium-reviews/ve7E2MbE9TY:\n\nwin: use /maxilksize on link to avoid LNK1248 'exceeds maximum allowable size (80000000)' \n\nNot sure if any of this information helps.

    "body": "Note, this is a naive response on my part. Node-Webkit has a different build process but they are able to accomplish a 64 bit build on Windows, granted it looks like the Chromium content layer is statically linked in the NW.exe. The size of the resulting exe is almost identical to the size of the chromium content DLL. Has anyone studied their build process to determine how they do it? Is this max size issue a DLL issue? Would Atom-Shell staff be willing to entertain a discussion of statically linking the Chromium content layer (brightray / libchromiumcontent) in Atom-Shell to achieve this? Perhaps that approach just on Windows for people who want a 64 bit build. Of course I'm over simplifying this, I have no idea what real hard work would need to take place to make this work. I'm just trying to lubricate the gears of thoughts and ideas and see if we can move this along.\n"

    "body": "Chromium has two different ways of building:\n- Chromium's release builds build a bunch of static libraries, then link them into the final Chrome DLLs. By linking everything into a single DLL that only exports the few functions that are needed by `chrome.exe`, the compiler/linker can eliminate dead code and perform whole-module optimizations. So this results in the smallest and fastest code.\n- A \"component build\" builds many smallish DLLs. This is used by Chromium developers as it speeds up incremental builds significantly (because in many cases you can get away with just recompiling the small DLL for the module you're working on). The DLLs end up being bigger in aggregate than the release build, and they aren't as fast due to all the cross-module calls that have to take place. This also requires each component to declare what symbols it needs to export so that other components higher up the dependency chain can call into them.\n\nlibchromiumcontent, which is used by atom-shell, builds yet another way: we compile all of Chromium into a single DLL, and reexport all the public symbols of all the component DLLs. This has the benefit of being simple for building against (just link against this one DLL and you're done) but results in a very large DLL (due to all the exported symbols) and probably isn't as fast as Chromium's release builds. It's also a bit of a pain to maintain this custom build process.\n\nI've talked with @zcbenz in the past about switching to using Chromium's two standard build styles. Basically we'd generate two versions of libchromiumcontent: a component build that can be used during development, and a release build that can be used for releases. It will be a little more work to set up atom-shell's build system to link in these two cases, but I believe will result in a smaller atom-shell package and hopefully faster code. And it should be able to link on Windows.\n"
