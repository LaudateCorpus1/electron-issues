It should be possible for a Chrome App to be killed at any point in time and so beforeunload cannot fire reliably. We should not have developers assuming this will work, when it only works some of the time. It seems the event DOES fire some of the time.\n\nnot emitting `beforeunload` should be the expected behavior, so I'm closing this.\n"
