    "body": "Looks like the node require is getting in the way. I suspect you'd need to do some sort of \"intelligent\" switching around to move it out of the way, eg. assigning the node require to another variable so requirejs's require could work. The \"intelligent\" part is magic because if you are using node-integration and loading random pages off the net that use requirejs then things are going to get ugly unless you can \"know\" eg parse the pages to see if they use requirejs or some other require that would break your node integrated webview. \n\nHaving node integration turned on for a webview enabled web browser plugin seems very risky unless you know exactly what and have control over the pages you are loading. \n"
