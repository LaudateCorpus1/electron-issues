    "body": "@webarchymeta From an initial investigation on my part I'm tempted to believe your system has been infected and the actual Electron files are fine.\n\nI downloaded a fresh version of Electron from the releases section and ran the referenced file (libEGL.dll) through http://virustotal.com and it came back with 0 detections.  As you can see here:  \nhttps://virustotal.com/en/file/5965c5703969bcdbd8a0d402764c71a2c0fbbb8f08d9cd1ca1081bf6bbca91d8/analysis/1473036035/\n\nCan you confirm what virus scanner you are using and whether using the same scanner on a completely separate system still reveals the issue?\n"

    "body": "The program that reports the virus is light.exe which is part of Microsoft WiX (installer building system). Since the only virus scanning system here is MS Security Essentials, the source of the report should come from the later. I tried to check my version of libEGL.dll on virusportal.com, the site didn't upload the file before reporting it had already been checked (I will belief they did checked the signature of the file before making such an report). So, it is quite strange ...\n\nI will reboot the my system to see what happens\n"
