    "body": "Thanks @deepak1556. I managed to open the second devtools from the remote debugging url, but it seems there's no way to debug the extension load.\nI'm trying to debug the issues with running Angular Batarang (#915). The extension starts by loading a file called devtoolsBackground.js . If I put a breakpoint on the first line of the file, it doesn't break. If I do the same in Google Chrome, I can reload the first devtools and then the breakpoint in the second devtools fires. Is there any way to get it to work when using remote debugging?\n\nIt seems that remote debugging works using websockets, so maybe reconnecting doesn't block, which means the script is loaded before the connection was re-created and that's why I'm missing the first breakpoint.\n"
