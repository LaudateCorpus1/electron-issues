    "body": "Thanks for the direction @frankhale!  I had looked into IPC, but I'm using [devtool](https://www.npmjs.com/package/devtool) which runs in a renderer thread so I don't have access to `ipcMain` (the IPC documentation seems to indicate that you can only use IPC between a renderer and the main thread, not between two renderers or a renderer and a webview). \r\n\r\nI'm loading 3rd party sites into a `<webview>` and `require(\"electron\")` doesn't seem to work in webviews (maybe I'm missing something here) so no IPC and I'm guessing I'd have trouble getting Socket.IO running via an executeJavascript() injected code snippet. \r\n\r\nI'll definitely look into IPC if I work with electron in the future.
