    "body": "Yes. I can. However, the code regarding hot exit is actually in a private reusable module called `electron-cache` which decides whether to save or not. I could hack it and raise a flag before calling `autoUpdater.quitAndInstall()` but this will defeat the purpose of having a module.\r\n\r\nI could workaround this as you suggested for now and reimplement the module inside of the app but it will be great if the API provides a clean way to know the reason for the window close.\r\n\r\n@kevinsawicki Do you know why the behaviour for `quitAndInstall()` have been chosen to not follow the same order of event firing?"
