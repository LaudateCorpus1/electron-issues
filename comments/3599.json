    "body": "Hi there! Having developed several menubar-only Mac apps myself, you should know that you may need to set the `LSBackgroundOnly` and `LSUIElement` keys to `YES` in your app's `Info.plist` in order to get the tooltip to function properly without a dock icon. You can read all about it in [Apple's Launch Services Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/LaunchServicesKeys.html).\r\n\r\nThis means that in order to set these keys, you'll need to bundle your app up using [electron-packager](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-packager) and possibly set the `Info.plist` keys yourself with scripts afterwards. Here is an excerpt of my app's `Info.plist` with these keys filled in:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<key>LSBackgroundOnly</key>\r\n<true/>\r\n<key>LSUIElement</key>\r\n<true/>\r\n```\r\n\r\nHope that helps! "
