    "body": "Possible workaround: apparently some SSL certs break `auto-updater` and some don't. All of our `wagonhq.com` certs seem to work fine.\n\nI tried serving the update files different ways and found:\n- Amazon's content certs break `auto-updater`. This includes\n  - `s3.amazonaws.com`\n  - `*.s3.amazonaws.com`\n  - `*.cloudfront.net`\n- Our \"normal\" SSL certs seem to work fine. For example [`*.wagonhq.com`](https://www.wagonhq.com/), which is a Comodo wildcard cert. I'm not sure what distinguishes this from Amazon's certs.\n- A simple self-signed cert breaks `auto-updater`.
