True it is a power user feature as not a lot of people can do it by themselves, but I can help and give you some pointers as we are building our own FFMPEG distribution which includes AAC and H264.\r\n\r\nThis needs to be discussed with @groundwater @zcbenz and @kevinsawicki as they are the maintainers and will probably need to care about some legal requirements."

    "body": "Hey @cifratila , I am aiming for true \"full\" suppert of videos so that the app badically plays anything ffmpeg is capable of. When you mention AAC and H264 it sounds a bit like that is not even possible and only a few more formats can be supported, or did i read you wrong. \r\n\r\nAs for licensing and shipping, why not distribute the expanded ffmpeg.so separately with a different license?"

I want to do an open source project and I live in Germany where (afaik) software patents aren't a thing. I tried building electron before and I remember it took all night and then failed. Anyhow, I can try again. It would be nice if you could point me in the right direction on how to build ffmpeg.so (with all its codecs enabled). I found [this](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/development/build-instructions-osx.md), of course, but I remember you'd have to pass some CLI parameters for ffmpeg and I can't find where I read this again and it would be nice to have a \"trustworthy\" source on this."
