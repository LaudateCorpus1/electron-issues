    "body": "Thought I'd chime in here.\n\nFirst of all the GPMDP/electron-chromecast module is hacky to say the least.  It is more of a polyfill than an implementation and it does the bare minimum required to \"Just Work\"(TM) with basic cast usage.\n\nI would love it if the Google Cast implementation inside Chromium could be ported to Electron.  However (and this is related to #5612) there are a number of issues I came across while attempting a port previously.\n1.  Google Chrome uses a built in MDNS scanner.  The MDNS spec says you must listen for and send requests from port `5353`.  Most Windows machines default firewall configuration block these requests without adding an exception to the firewall.  Adding an exception requires Admin permissions and most Electron applications aren't even installed with Admin permissions (let alone run with them).\n2.  Google Chrome has a built in UI for the Chromecast selector.  We would have to implement an interface similar to `electron-chromecast` where it allows clients to implement there on device chooser.\n3.  As far as I can tell, running two instances of Google Chrome's MDNS implementation **simultaneously** doesn't play nicely.  So running an Electron application with cast integration enabled and Google Chrome at the same time could cause issues.\n\nPersonally I have tried to do this implementation before and failed at these rather significant hurdles (hence the `electron-chromecast` implementation).\n"
