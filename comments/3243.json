Drawing this from the documentation at the top of the article:\n\n```\nThe native Node modules are supported by Electron, but since Electron is using a different V8 version\nfrom official Node, you have to manually specify the location of Electron's headers when building \nnative modules\n```\n\nQuestion 4: Without seeing your setup it's hard to know what the root cause of that error is. Might wanna try looking at the description here https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js/wiki/build-native-modules-with-nw-gyp\n\n```\nFor some packages you may need to use node-pre-gyp (e.g. when you get the error \"Undefined \nvariable module_name in binding.gyp while trying to load binding.gyp\"), which supports\nbuilding for both node.js and node-webkit by using either node-gyp or nw-gyp.\n```\n\nAnd not a problem, just as a note though for questions about usage of electron you'll probably want to use stack overflow or the discussion forum https://discuss.atom.io/c/electron rather than the issue log. Hope it helps :).\n"
