    "body": "@doonay21 I can reproduce this but only when right clicking on the transparent parts of the tray icon.  I think there is something wrong with the alpha channel in your PNG file as other apps don't experience this.  \r\n\r\nWhere did you get the tray icon from / how did you generate it?  Trying to figure out what exactly is different from let's say my tray icon which doesn't exhibit this behavior."
