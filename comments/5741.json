Many times designers will bundle subtly different images into a `.ico` because they know details will be lost/mangled when downsized. For example, here are **some** of the images contained in _GitHub for Desktop_'s `.ico` file:\n\n![app-0](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/308072/15622526/2deebffc-242f-11e6-8ca6-9a2cc24bcf17.png)\n\n![app-3](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/308072/15622530/33d196ce-242f-11e6-9b7c-b27ae64236d5.png)\n\n![app-4](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/308072/15622532/3663f1b6-242f-11e6-960e-7cb1af57d729.png)\n\nNote how the last one drops details because they just won't look good at that resolution.\n"
