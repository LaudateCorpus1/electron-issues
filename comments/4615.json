    "body": "I was getting the same errors with/without running a server. Since its the only place this issue is discussed, I am posting the fix here.\n\nI fixed it by adding Mime types to the IIS\n\n```\n<mimeMap fileExtension=\".\" mimeType=\"text/plain\" />\n<mimeMap fileExtension=\".nupkg\" mimeType=\"application/octet-stream\" />\n```\n\nThe full web.config in my case is something like the following\n\n```\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n\n<configuration>\n    <system.webServer>\n        <security>\n            <requestFiltering allowDoubleEscaping=\"True\"/>\n        </security>\n    </system.webServer>\n    <system.webServer>\n        <directoryBrowse enabled=\"true\" />\n        <staticContent>\n             <mimeMap fileExtension=\".\" mimeType=\"text/plain\" />\n             <mimeMap fileExtension=\".nupkg\" mimeType=\"application/octet-stream\" />\n         </staticContent>\n    </system.webServer>\n</configuration>\n```\n\nHope this helps...\n"
