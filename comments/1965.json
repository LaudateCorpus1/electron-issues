    "body": "I have updated the title to better reflect what I mean. Yes, its possible to do this from the renderer by catching the drop event, however there is other cases where the renderer can change where you have to manually interfere. For example, pressing the backspace key can sometimes cause a navigate-back. Also you need to install a click listener to prevent navigation. So you end up with 3 listeners to prevent the same thing. Having one API to prevent any changes in the page URL would solve all these cases imho.\n\nIf this API is not added then at least document all the workarounds one has to do to prevent browser behavior in that area.\n"
