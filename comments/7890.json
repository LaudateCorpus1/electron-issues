Also need to provide a mechanism where [brightray](https://github.com/electron/brightray/blob/master/browser/url_request_context_getter.cc#L203) can accept custom host resolver from embedder. You can look at how `AtomCertVerifier` was worked out.\n"

    "body": "Thanks both for your suggestions.\n\n@diyism I like the idea of putting the lookup behind chromium's DNS cache as I believe your method would allow, but I would need to start a local DNS server for my use-case, which is not ideal. It's also not clear to me if there's a way of replacing/wrapping the DnsConfigService at runtime without modifying the Chromium code. Please correct me if I'm wrong here though.\n\nI've got some way towards implementing a HostResolver hook as @deepak1556 suggests. My C++ skills are very rusty though and I've run into some pointer issues. I'll push my changes onto a branch later this weekend and maybe someone can see spot what's wrong.\n"
