    "body": "Oh and thanks for anyone who can look at this problem, Electron is great! :D\r\n\r\nThere is a workaround to this problem by using the Electron's web request API:\r\nhttps://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/api/web-request.md\r\n\r\nAnd passing the Cookie header on the onBeforeSendHeaders listener. Than it works.\r\n\r\nBut I think Electron XMLHttpRequest API should work like on Chrome without any workaround."
