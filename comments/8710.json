    "body": "This is a pretty serious issue for us.  Basically we have a \"real-time\" application running in Node.JS and Electron is causing it to halt for arbitrary long periods if someone moves the window around.  This is not an issue with standard GUI applications on Windows or Ubuntu, rather this limitation of locking the main loop when the window is being moved is imposed by either Chromium or Electron."

If you or @bhouston have any more information about your applications, we could use that as a user-story when working on the feature.\r\n\r\nWe can also have a look and see if this problem is avoidable, or too baked into the architecture to avoid without using other threads.

    "body": "@groundwater Thanks for the attention!  Wohoo!\r\n\r\nI can describe the app at a high level.  It is a near real-time signal processing tool that uses a lot of CUDA via Node.JS NAN plugin and has a 3D front end and React.js-based GUI.  Basically electron allows for a cross platform application with a rich UI at very low cost -- basically a replacement for Qt's normal role.  We love electron and it has saved us a ton of money in development.  It helps that we are a web-focused development shop with lots of web front-end experience.  While our app doesn't have hard real-time constraints like a true real-time control system, it does output processed sound in a real-time nature.  This sound is composed of a lot of short segments (as they come out of the real-time processing system) that if we have near real-time behavior out of the app, it keeps the output audio buffer from going empty and thus the sound appears continuous.  This mostly works until the user decides to move the window with the React.JS GUI in it and then there is a good chance (but not fully consistent -- it seems to increase its consistency the more stuff the main thread is doing) the sound and display (which is also feed real-time) stops updating because the main loop blocked on something.  This blocking continues until they release their mouse cursor or stop moving the window -- I am a little confused on exactly what triggers the end of the block.\r\n\r\nAnother clue: We know that Chromium will keep playing a Three.JS animation even when moving or resizing the window on Ubuntu and Windows.  Thus this doesn't block Chromium."
