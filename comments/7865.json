    "body": "Have you verified that your Chrome and Electron installs are both 32-bit or 64-bit? I just realized that my Chrome install was 32-bit while \"npm install electron\" defaulted to 64-bit since I'm on a 64-bit system. Chrome is 32-bit unless it mentions 64-bit in its version string, For example, Chrome's About page should show a version like: Version 54.0.2840.87 m (64-bit).\n\nTry running 'file' on your browsers and the widevine .so's to make sure they are built for the same arch. I'm on Windows and that's what tipped me off.\n\nOutput from 'file' before and after the switch:\n\n> widevinecdm.dll: PE32 executable (DLL) (console) Intel 80386, for MS Windows\n> widevinecdm.dll: PE32+ executable (DLL) (console) x86-64, for MS Windows\n\nUpgrading Chrome to 64-bit, loading some DRM content (Netflix in my case), and then copying over the updated widevine DLLs fixed it for me. Prior to this I could not get widevine or flash content to load.\n\nWorked for me using both Electron 1.4.2 and 1.4.5 using Widevine 1.4.8.903 under Windows 10.\n\nIf you would prefer to switch Electron to 32-bit, try \"npm install -g --arch=ia32 electron\". That was going to be my next attempt if I had trouble switching to 64-bit Chrome.\n"
