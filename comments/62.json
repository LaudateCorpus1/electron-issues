    "body": "Atom-shell needs to ask the renderer whether the window can be closed when the X is clicked, so simply hide the window does not work. For example, the \"confirm close\" dialog in Atom can cancel the close, if we hide the window the dialog would not be seen by users.\n\nI think when the X is clicked, we can check whether the window has been unresponsive for a while (for example 2 seconds), if it does Atom can show the \"renderer is unresponsive\" dialog and let the user decide whether to wait or force closing it. Simply terminating the renderer could surprise the users, because they may be expecting a \"confirm close\" dialog but the window just closes. Does this solution work for you?\n"
