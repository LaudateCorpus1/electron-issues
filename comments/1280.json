    "body": "`project_name` is like the executable file's name of your app, and `product_name` will be used as your app's name. It is totally fine to use the same name for both, but sometimes people would prefer a short lower-cased name for `project_name`.\n\nAs an example, in Atom editor, `project_name` is `atom` and `product_name` is `Atom`.\n"
