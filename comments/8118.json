On Windows and Linux, the menu will be set as each windowâ€™s top menu.\r\n\r\nSo I don't know if this is the case with all linux distribution, but i think this should be documented."

A application menu is a single menu that shared by all windows, which is not supported by Linux.\r\n\r\nFor Linux `Menu.setApplicationMenu` just sets the same menu bar for all windows, so for desktop environments that support global menu bar, it looks like that the application has a single application menu, while they are actually differently menu bars.\r\n\r\nThis difference is very important, because for desktop environments that do not support global menu bar, the menu set by `Menu.setApplicationMenu` would be showed as menu bar inside each window."
