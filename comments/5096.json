    "body": "In the browser context alert() can work. So if I use Electron with nodeIntegrate set to false I should expect the same result. At least that is what I should expect?\n\nAlso since I am needing it to mirror the results of the browser context and not the node/Electron context I can't use the VM module for this case. Thanks for the suggestion though.\n\nThe idea is to not call a particular method but eval complete scripts. So I can't get away with iframe.contentWindow.method either. I tried to document.write script tags with it in place but I didn't get the results I was looking for as well due to browser restrictions. I have a few other ideas for a work around but won't try them until I am in the office Monday.\n\nEither way, I just thought Electron in this usage should replicate Chromium. But I also know this is a fringe case type of situation.\n"
