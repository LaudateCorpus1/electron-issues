    "body": "Thanks.  The current webview API already enables a nice browser.  I don't\nsee any rush to future improvements.  I might still ask for them though.\n (grin)\n\nBTW, a lot of people, including myself originally, thought a browser in\nAtom was silly since you can always click into the real browser.  However,\nI have a set of features coming out soon that will show some advantages to\na built-in browser.\n\nOn Mon, Feb 2, 2015 at 11:14 AM, Cheng Zhao notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> but could webview give an event with the URL when the mouse hovers over a\n> link?\n> \n> You can make use of the preload attribute to load a script in webview to\n> capture the hovering events on links and then use ipc.sendToHost API to\n> tell the host page.\n> \n> There is actually a native Chromium event for this, but not exposed in\n> atom-shell yet.\n> \n> It would also be nice if the start-loading event gave the URL.
