    "body": "Can you provide a minimal app that reproduces the issue?  I know you provided some small code but there is no way anyone is going to dig through the source code of that minified site to try figure out what it is doing to help you. 😢 \n\nFrom what I can see something must be failing inside your site's JS code that's causing it not to load.  Interestingly in Chrome I get this warning\n\n```\nNavigator.pointerEnabled is a non-standard API added for experiments only. It will be removed in near future.\n```\n\nWhen checking inside electron `navigator.pointerEnabled` is indeed `undefined` instead of a `Boolean` as the API indicates it should be.  In other words it looks like you are using a depreceated / unofficial navigator API.\n\nThis might not be the issue, and I have no idea what is.  But whatever it is, it is almost certainly an issue with your site and not with Electron.  So as mentioned before without narrowing down what **exactly** on your site is causing the issue there is now way anyone can help you.\n\nI've done the standard check for crashes / error logs and as far as I can tell your site is deciding not to do anything.\n"

    "body": "@deepak1556 @eric-naguras I have good news I tracked it down to one line of code inside the minified logic on their website.\n\n``` js\nwindow.Buffer\n```\n\nBasically they are not setting the initial cookies if certain things exist on the window object, one of those things is `window.Buffer`\n\nCalling `window.Buffer = null` in the preload script makes the website load correctly 👍 \n\nConsidering this is website specific code (nothing to do with Electron) I think we should close this issue out @deepak1556 ?\n\nFWIW @eric-naguras It looks like that code is being used to identify if the website is running in a test suite or not.  I made that assumption because it checks for the following things\n\n``` js\nvar U = \"domAutomationController\";\nvar b = \"domAutomation\";\nvar D = \"webdriver\";\nvar k = \"spawn\";\nvar Q = \"emit\";\nvar H = \"Buffer\";\nvar y = \"__phantomas\";\nvar o = \"callPhantom\";\nvar M = \"_phantom\";\n```\n"
