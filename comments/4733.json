It's peculiar that @CharlieHess is able to reproduce this with `0.36.9`!\n\nCurrently, when comparing `10` and `11`:\n- With `10`, `remove()` is being called once on startup, and it's being applied to a `Menu` object\n- With `11`, `remove()` is being called twice on startup: once for a `Menu`, and the other to a `BrowserWindow` object (_the_ `BrowserWindow` object0\n- Following the code backwards, it looks like `v8Util` is calling the `destructor` for the `BrowserWindow` on `11`, but not `10`.\n\nUnfortunately, I can't build `electron` prior to `v0.37.0` for some reason. I might need to figure out why that's not working before I can continue fixing this\n"

    "body": "Ah, I've figured out a sort-of symptom of the problem that I was having. There _is_ a difference between `0.36.10` and `0.36.11`, but it's based off of a bug that has existed for longer (e.g. `0.36.9` probably).\n\nMy issue was that `BrowserWindow` was being removed from `objects-registry`. In `0.36.10`, my application was the first to ever request a handle for the `BrowserWindow`. Electron would happily provide it, and life was good.\n\nIn `0.36.11`, [Electron needed to get `BrowserWindow` for its own purposes](https://github.com/atom/electron/compare/v0.36.10...v0.36.11#diff-be9eb62ca5c2374dd40c5e689111f99cR11). This _should_ be fine. This created an entry in the registry, so when my application requested the `BrowserWindow`, it would reuse the entry.\nHowever, due to the **spooky bug**, the original entry becomes a null pointer, and a later reference to it kills everything in a fiery apocalypse of doom.\n\nAs for the bug itself:\nI think that it's due to a race condition. I have a terrible, self-made log here:\n(Note: `1` is the objects-registry id for `BrowserWindow`, and `5` is `Menu`. The others don't matter too much)\n`::OnObjectGC()` and `::RunCallback()` are from `object_life_monitor.cc`\n`add() and get()` are from `objects-registry.js`\n\n```\n// Electron commit 67db92d500632548466149770e4ae2cd7445999b\nadd:  1 // Electron getting BrowserWindow for figuring out visibility\nget:  1\nget:  1\n::OnObjectGC() 1 // V8 marks pointer to BrowserWindow as garbage collected (?)\nadd:  2 // Other objects are added: functions, Menus, etc\nadd:  3\nadd:  4\nget:  3\nget:  2\nadd:  5\nget:  5\nget:  2\nget:  3\nadd:  1 // Note that something else (my application) is now using `BrowserWindow`. Since the garbage-collect from earlier (see ::OnObjectGC) hasn't propagated to `object-registry`, things get in a bad state\nget:  4\nadd:  1\nget:  1 // This works for some reason, I think? Perhaps the actual garbage collection occurs around the same time as ::RunCallback()?\n::OnObjectGC() 5\n::RunCallback() 1\nremove:  4 1\n::RunCallback() 5\nremove:  4 5\n\n```\n\n@zcbenz can I get your input on this? Maybe you can point me in the right direction? I think I've made some good progress, but I want to confirm my suspicions before I attempt a fix\n"
