Purely because if I call `app.quit()` as @djpereira said \n\n> it is expected that calling app.quit() closes the app irrespectively of how the windows are built.\n\nCalling `window.close()` should obviously fail, but calling `app.quit()` I feel shouldn't care about \"windows\" per say, rather it is trying to terminate the app as a whole?\n"
