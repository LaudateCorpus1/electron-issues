Now they're not, and [every API has its own markdown file](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/7969).\r\n\r\nThere's no practical reason to keep using `<h2>` instead of `<h1>`; it's just going to require a bit of extra work if we want to change them all. At a minimum, this would have to happen:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Decrement heading levels in the markdown doc of every Class.\r\n- [ ] Update the styleguide to reflect the new rules.\r\n- [ ] Update [electron-docs-linter](https://github.com/electron/electron-docs-linter/blob/3c0128cafa3efecdaecefd094a11c830c096acb4/lib/api.js#L43-L50) to account for changes.\r\n\r\n@fab1an if you want to take a shot at those first two items,  I'd be willing to do the work of updating the linter."
