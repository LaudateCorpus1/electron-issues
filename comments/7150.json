    "body": "Haven't used credentials api just read the spec, but chromium doesn't throw the error with `file` scheme. ~~So its a bug in Electron~~ Electron has to integrate `password_manager` component for the api to work. Aside from it, why would you want to use the api with `file` scheme, it doesn't have any origin concept and there are algorithms in the spec that rely on `origin` which would definitely cause you problem.\n"
