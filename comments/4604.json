    "body": "You can use `chrome://media-internals/` to find debug information on how Electron is handling any media it is currently playing. So far, on my Mac, I've seen `FFmpegVideoDecoder` with `--disable-gpu` switch, `DecryptingVideoDecoder` with Widevine content, and `GpuVideoDecoder`.\n\nHowever Electron will be inheriting the decoding capabilities from upstream projects - Chromium and FFmpeg. I would expect you to see the same behaviour in Chrome if you tried playback there.\n"
