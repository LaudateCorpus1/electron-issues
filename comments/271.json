    "body": "Hi,\nThis is a known issue of the Chrome.\nFor example see [this](http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=327269) Chrome bug ticket.\nBut, there are quite a lot of the people how fixed that by tweaking ALSA settings. In general you should create \"default\" ALSA device or install pulseaudio:\n\n> I've just discovered that something (maybe Jack or maybe alsaloop) had messed with my ALSA configuration and disabled the default PCM device. Chromium wasn't to blame and HTML5 videos weren't to blame. [source](http://www.pclinuxos.com/forum/index.php?topic=123631.0)\n\nAnother one:\n\n> Solved by installing [pulseaudio](http://slackbuilds.org/repository/14.1/audio/pulseaudio/) from the sbopkg.org repository.\n> Before compilation, follow instructions typed:\n> \n> ``` bash\n> # groupadd -g 216 pulse\n> # useradd -u 216 -g pulse -d /var/lib/pulse pulse\n> ```\n> \n> Next installed\n> json-c-0.11-i486-1_SBo.tgz\n> speex-1.2rc1-i486-3_SBo.tgz\n> pulseaudio-2.0-i486-1_SBo.tgz\n>  After restart everything works fine.\n> [source in Russian](http://linuxforum.ru/viewtopic.php?pid=395206)\n"
