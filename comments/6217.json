    "body": "I'm using mdl's textfield like this:\n    `<!-- Simple Textfield -->`\n    `<form action=\"#\">`\n      `<div class=\"mdl-textfield mdl-js-textfield\">`\n        `<input class=\"mdl-textfield__input\" type=\"text\" id=\"sample1\">`\n        `<label class=\"mdl-textfield__label\" for=\"sample1\">Text...</label>`\n     `</div>`\n    `</form>`\nCan you see the issue? Exactly, the form has a `#` action. Which causes the page to redirect to itself. Weirdly tho, I can't replicate the issue on my webserver, however, I now know that the `<form>` was the issue. I'm sorry for being uninformed and for waisting everyone's time.\n"
