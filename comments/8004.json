    "body": "> The update replaces all the folders and files. Is there a way to exclude some of them? Or is this a Squirrel related thing?\n\nThere is no way to exclude them, the entire app is replaced on every update. You can store generated files in other locations outside the app though so they don't get replaced.\n\nSee http://electron.atom.io/docs/api/app/#appgetpathname for more details on getting paths to special locations on disk that can be used.\n"
