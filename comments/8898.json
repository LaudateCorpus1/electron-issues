    "body": "Agreed. I also assumed that subclassing would 'just work', being unaware of the complexities (as discussed in #23). Currently the failure mode is non-obvious (my app silently froze after showing a Save dialog). In addition to the docs update, perhaps we could add runtime checks to BrowserWindow to ensure it wasn't subclassed? e.g. \r\n\r\n    if(this.constructor !== BrowserWindow) {\r\n        throw new Error('BrowserWindow cannot be subclassed')\r\n    }\r\n"
