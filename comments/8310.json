Thoughts?\r\n\r\nI couldn't seem to see a documented `setTransparent` method on the `BrowserWindow`, does this mean it's currently not possible to change that property after the window has been created?\r\n\r\nIf it is possible (but there's just no current API for it), I think it would make sense to set the window to transparent if there's a vibrancy set."
