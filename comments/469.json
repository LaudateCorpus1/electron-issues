    "body": "okay, according to https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit/issues/213 \nhere is my solution:\n1. encapsulate cpp addons with any version of node(in my case 0.11.13)\n2. copy node.exe(v0.11.13) to my lib\n3. use child_process.spawn('node.exe', ['myEncapsulation.js', {cwd: path.resolve(__dirname), stdio: ['ipc']}]);\n4. use ipc to communication\n\npros:\n- i can easily un-require my addon by calling kill()\n- can be used between node versions as long as ipc protocol is stable\n\ncons:\n- need another node.exe in my project\n- need extra logic of handling message(events, callbacks, state-machines ...)\n\nand one more questions:\ndo atom-shell support child_process.fork? how to use it correctly?\nis there a way to use the native node.exe inside the atom.exe, so i don't have to require another node.exe in my project?\n"
