    "body": "@tommoor Agreed that the fade effect should be native if you are trying to replicate an OS specific effect. I presume you are trying to replicate the whole thing then? Borders, shadows, etc?\n\nI suggested the CSS/JS route because this window type isn't supported in Electron. I don't think the fade should be an option though, rather the OS chooses to animate it if the type of window you have chosen animates natively or not... and if it doesn't then doesn't animate! (after all isn't the animations in OS X a user preference? So it'd be cool to honor this.)\n\nIf it was a new option for all windows and not tied in to the type, you'd be adding an effect that isn't seen in the OS anywhere else on native windows. It's fine for frameless because they are outside of the UI guidelines.\n\nSo in short.. I guess the best approach would be to add this window type to Electron.\n"
