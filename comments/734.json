    "body": "So does the latest window style change that was recently commited make the window border underneath the frameless overlay go away? Yes and No. \n\nKeep in mind these are only from my tests. Your mileage may vary.\n\nWindows 8.1 - Yes, you cannot see anomalies when resizing.\nWindows 8.1 high contrast theme - Yes, you cannot see anomalies when resizing.\nWindows 7 with basic theme (non Aero) - Yes,  you cannot see anomalies when resizing.\nWindows 7 with classic theme - Yes, you cannot see anomalies when resizing.\nWindows 7 with Aero - No, you see the border underneath if your eyes are really fast or your machine is really slow. I still find it hard to see on the Windows 7 machine I have access to. It is definitely noticeable if you know what to look for.\n\nNOTE: using Atom-Shell 0.19.1 a frameless app crashes on Windows 7 with a basic theme (non Aero) as well as Windows 8.1 using the high contrast theme. If you built from master it will not crash as far as I can tell.\n\nI don't know yet if there is a window style that will be the fix for all situations. I'll keep digging.\n"

    "body": "To be fair this isn't only a Win 7 Aero issue. I can see the same issue on Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 Tech Preview. I've spent the entire day wrapped up in this and am quite familiar now with what is going on. The window styles set on the top level window need to be there so that window minimization and maximization animations happen like on a normal window. Among other things...\n\nIt looks as though the browser window or more importantly the content view or whatever it's name is that Chrome handles is set to extend into the non-client area of it's parent window. So when frameless you only think it's frameless. The frame is hidden from view and underneath the content view. Resizing that frame and CPU lag and asynchronous aspects of Chrome allow you to peek behind that window to see what is beneath. \n\nI'm not completely done trying to fix this. Apparently some magic with hooking into the WndProc of the top level window can be done to force the borders and controls to not paint there by giving us what we want. I'm currently going down this road but my first attempt last night and the PR this morning was not correct. \n"

    "body": "This can be fixed pretty easily but we'll lose minimize and maximize animations which make the frameless window appear like a normal window when minimizing and restoring from the taskbar. This functionality was recently merged but https://github.com/atom/atom-shell/issues/751 wasn't closed out. Right now today we can resolve this issue with a fix or resolve the other with a fix but not both.\n\nTo get rid of the non-client controls (and border) the following can be done in the NativeWindowViews constructor in native_window_views.cc. We need to remove the window styles from the top level window that are causing the problems.\n\n``` cpp\n#if defined(OS_WIN)\n  if (!has_frame_ && ui::win::IsAeroGlassEnabled()) {\n      HWND hwnd = GetAcceleratedWidget();\n\n      LONG frame_style = ::GetWindowLong(hwnd, GWL_STYLE);\n      frame_style &= ~(WS_CAPTION | WS_THICKFRAME | WS_MINIMIZE | WS_MAXIMIZE |\n        WS_SYSMENU);\n      ::SetWindowLong(hwnd, GWL_STYLE, frame_style);\n\n      // Redraw the frame so the changes take effect.\n      ::SetWindowPos(hwnd, NULL, 0,0,0,0, SWP_FRAMECHANGED | SWP_NOMOVE |\n        SWP_NOSIZE | SWP_NOZORDER | SWP_NOOWNERZORDER);\n  }\n#endif\n```\n\nThere seems to be other more elaborate ways to do it without sacrificing the functionality the window styles give you but I couldn't get it to work. Those ways involve hooking into the WndProc and catching window messages and modifying the default behavior (such as the painting of the non-client area). \n\nAdditionally, I could not figure out how to properly set up the hook to trap the window messages. I spent around 15 hours on it. The main issue was obtaining the proper thread ID for the window. It's not as easy as calling GetWindowThreadProcessId on the window handle. There is more to it from what I can gather. Using Spy++ on the window I can see that a call to GetWindowThreadProcessId infact gives me a different ThreadId than what is reported. I tried EnumWindows as well but was not able to make it work even by looking at all the windows and thread ID's and attempting to match it up. I also tried getting the Module handle to use in setting up the hook instead of the thread ID but that caused all sorts of problems for me.\n\nI'd be really happy if somebody knows how to do this and could show me. There are other areas it may be beneficial to hook into the underlying WndProc to trap window messages (in lieu of the Aura API way which I have not tracked down any documentation on yet).\n"

    "body": "@iamdriz, I've pretty much done all I can do for this one. The way frameless works as far as I can tell is not at all to turn off window decorations on Windows but rather to extend the client area into the non-client area there by hiding the titlebar, minimize, maximize and close buttons. Resizing windows from the left edge seems to expose the controls underneath as the CPU tries to keep up with all the repainting. There are real trade offs by setting the Window style to eliminate these controls and it creates real problems and we lose functionality (as noted above). \n\nMy guess is that we are going to need more crazy Win32 code in order to provide the illusion that those controls aren't actually underneath the frameless window.\n"

We used to remove those styles, but then there were new problems, like there is no animation when minimizing and maximizing window, and maximized window will cover the taskbar. Basically if one window doesn't have `WS_THICKFRAME` and `WS_CAPTION` styles, Windows will not treat it as normal window.\n\nBut there is still work around, after setting `backgroundColor` for `BrowserWindow`, the chrome will be covered with the background color, which is not perfect, but should have solved this problem,\n"

    "body": "I've been looking into this to see if I can make @lukeapage's use case viable. In particular, I'm just interested in disabling `WS_THICKFRAME` (and `WS_CAPTION`).\n\nI'm a little unsure about removing the window styles. From [MSDN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms632600%28v=vs.85%29.aspx):\n\n> After the window has been created, these styles cannot be modified, except as noted.\n\nUnfortunately, `WS_THICKFRAME` (aka `WS_SIZEBOX`) has no exception, and using Spy++ I see that `WS_THICKFRAME` remains despite our attempted removal. So I imagine we need to modify the initial call to `CreateWindow`. \n\nThis led me into `GetAcceleratedWidget()`, which leads into libchromiumcontent/brightray (via `views::Widget`). Building in debug mode brings down libchromiumcontent, and a `grep` on this doesn't show any CreateWindow calls, although admittedly this may not find CreateWindow calls inside pre-compiled libraries.\n\nAt this stage I don't know enough about libchromiumcontent or its dependencies to know if it's possible to create a window in electron without `WS_THICKFRAME` - I assume this is how NW.js handles it? If there's anything I've missed or existing API to create a window without the `WS_THICKFRAME` style, I'd be interested in knowing about it, although I imagine without providing the plumbing through to the window creation, this can't really be done?\n"
