In general, you should also check the console for any errors first.\n\nAlso, [we're trying to control the amount of Issues that we have to triage and track](http://blog.atom.io/2016/04/19/managing-the-deluge-of-atom-issues.html). For support questions like this, [the Electron message board](https://discuss.atom.io/c/electron) or the [Electron Slack channel](http://atom-slack.herokuapp.com/) is where you'll probably be able to find answers faster.\n"
