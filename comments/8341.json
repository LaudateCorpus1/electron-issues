    "body": "> The overrides in lib/renderer/override,js can be removed ?\r\n\r\nI didn't remove them because they both support a second `title` parameter that isn't part of the DOM API and so it isn't supported via the Chrome dialog manager. And so I didn't want to break any existing behavior where apps are passing a custom title.\r\n\r\nWe could remove them in 2.0 though."
