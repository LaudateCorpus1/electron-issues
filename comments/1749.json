As you mention is a really nice approach.\nThe main problem is that i want to open that Go-lang backend automatically after opening the Electron app, so it will work more brainless for the end user. \nI don't know exactly how to integrate the shell module mentioned before.\nAny idea how to approach this ?\n"
