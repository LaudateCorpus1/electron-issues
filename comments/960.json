Long-term, I don't have a problem using the `atom-shell-starter` scripts, but when picking up a new framework, it's nice to bite off a few pieces at a time and the gulp and grunt scripts really help a person do this, especially given that both grunt and gulp are already integrated into most JavaScript developers workflow.
