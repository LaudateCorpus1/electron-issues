    "body": "GitHub issues are for feature requests and bug reports, questions / support requests about using Electron should be directed to the [community](https://github.com/electron/electron#community) or to the [Slack Channel](http://atom-slack.herokuapp.com/).\n\nThis appears to be a question / issue with the Electron application in question rather than Electron itself.\n\n> I am facing this frustrating issue for last 1 week. Everything was working fine earlier.\n\nLook through your commit log for the last week, a good trick is to just diff 1 week ago to today and see what has changed.   Look for any added `app.exit`, `app.quit` or `process.exit` calls that you may have added.  Things don't just magically stop working there is always a reason 👍 \n\n> What could be the possible reason? How can I figure this one out?\n\nFor more advanced debugging try setting the following environment variables and launching from command line\n\n``` bash\nset ELECTRON_ENABLE_LOGGING=true\nset ELECTRON_ENABLE_STACK_DUMPING=true\nC:\\Users\\u\\AppData\\Local\\MyElectronApp\\app-0.0.45\\MyElectron App.exe\n```\n"
