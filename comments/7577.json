Am I correct to think this means requests using the `net` module will appear in the network panel of the Dev Tools?\n\nIt may be worthwhile to explicitly document the specific API differences between `net` and node's `http`/`https` modules. I imagine a lot of people will be looking to transition their code to `net` instead so it would be handy to know what API differences to look out for when migrating.\n"

If, at some point, Electron provides a Browser-process Dev Tools, then yes it would be feasible to inspect `net` module requests. However, contrary to Node.js requests, `net` module requests will automatically appear in usual traffic-inspection tools such as Fiddler. \n"
