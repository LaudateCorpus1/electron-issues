    "body": "@vKepler Sorry if I didn't explain clear enough.\r\n\r\nThe `app` object is an [`EventEmitter`](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html), this means that calling `.on` adds an event listener.  See [`emitter.on`](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_emitter_on_eventname_listener).  The syntax for that function is\r\n\r\n```js\r\nemitter.on(eventName, listenerFunction)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere `listenerFunction` is a function, in your code you provide the event name correctly, but instead of providing a function you provide the **result** of the function (in this case your function returns `undefined`.\r\n\r\nIn order to fix this you simply make an anonymous function as I described so that the event listener is a function and not undefined\r\n\r\n```js\r\napp.on('ready', () => createWindow(600, 800))\r\n```"

To be so honest I wasn't even sure where .on() was coming from or what the API was doing there. I refactored my code with these changes and it works, Thanks bro."
