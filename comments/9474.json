    "body": "This is not a regression, the default behavior of fetch api with file scheme is same as chrome. Although the spec supports file scheme, there is no guidelines. Hence explicit support was avoided. You can add fetch support to file scheme in your app by using [webFrame.registerURLSchemeAsPrivileged](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/api/web-frame.md#webframeregisterurlschemeasprivilegedscheme-options) api. I would also recommend to avoid setting privileges to file scheme and instead create a custom protocol that is privileged. Closing this out, thanks!"

As you suggest the behavior should be consistent for both but changing it now will break apps, we can streamline this in 2.0. In the meantime we can document the behavior of file scheme and promote the use of custom protocols."
