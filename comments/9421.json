    "body": "@alexey-sh That code will remove a lot more than just the touch bar events, it will remove a whole bunch of internal Electron events as well.  You shouldn't ever call `removeAllListeners` if you weren't personally responsible for adding all the listeners to that object, it will cause unintended side effects like this. Things like our internal `blur` listeners and such will also be removed.\r\n\r\nI would say adding docs to say just don't use `removeAllListeners` on a browser window would be a good recommendation 👍 "
