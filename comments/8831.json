    "body": "The `setPressedImage` simply calls the native API, which behaves in this way, it is also consistent with behaviors of other UI frameworks. And if you ever implemented a similar thing, you would find this behavior actually quite reasonable.\r\n\r\nClosing since it is expected behavior. A pull request to explicitly document it would be welcomed though."
