    "body": "The problem is with Electron arch package, since they are building with custom chromium and they seem to have fixed it https://git.archlinux.org/svntogit/community.git/commit/trunk?h=packages/electron&id=d14c8d8c671b32b9db84a6035e069f0ae2f36b00 . Closing this out since its not a bug in Electron.\n\nI believe the repo you would want to raise the issue is https://github.com/tensor5/arch-atom\n"
