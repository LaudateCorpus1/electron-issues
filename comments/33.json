    "body": "The `autoUpdater.setFeedUrl` is just a thin wrap around `[SUUpdater sharedUpdater] setFeedURL:`, so this is indeed an issue of Sparkle.\n\nThe feed url set by `setFeedURL` will be remembered in `NSUserDefaults`, and when reading the feed url, Sparkle would first check `NSUserDefaults`, and if it finds one, it would use the found one instead of the one specified in `Info.plist`:\nhttps://github.com/aroben/Sparkle/blob/master/SUUpdater.m#L427\n\nSo once you used `setFeedURL`, `SUFeedURL` in `Info.plist` will never work.\n\nSetting the right feed url with `setFeedUrl` again could fix this, or maybe we should patch Sparkle so it doesn't check `NSUserDefaults`?\n"
