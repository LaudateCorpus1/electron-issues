But when we completed the task with Electron v0.37.3 all was fine - so maybe the problem comes with Windows updates as well.\n\nAs for the recent builds of Windows 10 we got this:\nElectron v0.37.5 - x86 works, x64 doesn't work\nElectron v0.37.2 - x86 works, x64 works\n\nWould be glad to help more with it, but don't work with native development for years.\n"

But if we check `get_Setting` in the first time, it will always return DISABLED.\n"
