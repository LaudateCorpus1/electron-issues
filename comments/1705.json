Specifically `/usr/local/bin` (where I have `node`) was not in `$PATH`.\n\nI don't claim to have a source of truth as to exactly how Xcode sets `$PATH` for script actions, however, it appears to be a handful of paths from Xcode.app (toolchain & platform sdk & such) and `/usr/bin`, `/bin`, `/usr/sbin`, `/sbin`.\n\nI added `/usr/bin` and `/bin` for completeness to cover the usual suspects, as the script was doing for Windows.\n"
