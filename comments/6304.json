    "body": "> any workaround to get it work? maybe a git init before run the bootstrap script?\n\nI don't think `git init` will help since each submodule needs to be at a specific SHA-1 and that information is stored in `.git` and would be missing in a newly initialized repository.\n\nI'm not sure there is a way to build from the tarball currently. It would require modifying the bootstrap script to initialize the submodules to have the correct commit checked out in each.\n"
