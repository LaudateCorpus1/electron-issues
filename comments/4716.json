    "body": "I'm :-1: on copying original source files to `chromium_src`, the problem is only very few files can be compiled without modifications, and for some classes like `BrowserProcess` and `Profile`, we are just providing a dummy class to satisfy a few files, if we copy the original files, it basically would mean we have to copy everything under `chrome`.\n\nI'm more willing to take the hard way, by fixing the compilation errors in each file one by one. And I think it is probably the only way that would work.\n"
