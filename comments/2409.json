I will try to remove the handler code on \"dragover\"  and \"drop\",\n\nBut this is only snippet we have in script, regarding drag and drop event preventing users to drop\nany elements / images / files into app. but we use webview extensively. users are dropping/ dragging a text/html element from one browserwindow to another browserwindow.\n\nTo prevent that we did this code in several, browser-windows. I am not sure whether it might  help, but just thought of adding info to this issue\n\n```\nwindow.addEventListener(\"dragover\", function(e) {\n    event.preventDefault();\n    return false;\n}, false);\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"drop\", function(e) {\n    event.preventDefault();\n    return false;\n}, false);\n\n```\n\nPlus i will try to do the same thing in chrome and try between to browser tabs / create a webview in chrome app.  Ah, chrome bug system in sloppy. there are bugs which we have reported 2 years back :(\n\nAnyway thank you @zcbenz \n"
