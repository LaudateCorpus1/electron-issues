I'm not sure by looking at the code though - does it store the certificate in the system's certificate store, or just import it for use during the current lifecycle of the application?\n\nI'm all for the latter if that's possible, but I understand if it's only possible to do the former. If you could do both though it would be pretty cool to have a flag to control it.\n\nThanks again for looking into this!\n"
