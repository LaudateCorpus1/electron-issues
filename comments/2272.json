    "body": "On Windows and Linux you can not make your app have real kiosk mode without making your app behave like virus, because you have to block keyboard events, disable the shell, preventing task manager to start, etc. So in Electron kiosk mode behaves the same with fullscreen mode on Windows and Linux, and this behavior won't be fixed.\n\nBut if you have full control of user's computer, you may edit the Windows registry to achieve it: https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js/issues/3318#issuecomment-89281703.\n"
