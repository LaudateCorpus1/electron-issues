    "body": "Sorry, I assumed `--prof` is known. A good introduction can be found [here](https://github.com/v8/v8/wiki/V8%20Profiler) but in short `--prof` enables V8's internal profiler that samples on JavaScript and C/C++ code. The workflow goes like this:\r\n\r\n* start nodejs with `--js-flags=\"--prof\"`and run your program to finish\r\n* a log file, `v8.log`, will be created. It contains low-level'ish information that can be process by other tools, like the tick processor, time line plotter etc\r\n\r\nThe problem here is that the log file from the main process doesn't contain 'tick'- information. \r\n\r\n![screen shot 2016-12-09 at 14 02 02](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1794099/21049984/4f7f80ce-be18-11e6-9734-4faf053f3cb8.png)\r\n\r\nI am unsure if this should have been covered by https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/3412 or not. Also, I read [this](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/3767#issuecomment-164333772) which might make this a feature request"
