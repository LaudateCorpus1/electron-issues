I haven't looked into how your module works but that would save a lot of manual refactoring I think 😆 \n\nMost of the fixes appear to be semi-colons and basic formatting that `standard-format` would fix 😄 \n"

The `standard-markdown` module could definitely be adapted to do this, but I think we should discuss a more sustainable long-term approach to managing docs translations in general before diving into linting all the JS there.\n"
