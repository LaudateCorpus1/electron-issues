    "body": "The ASAR will have to remain read only because of restrictions due to it's design. You have a standard cross platform solution on how to do this. This can be achieved by using node.js and not a custom C++ addon.\n\nYou can check and make a working directory if it is missing. Then copy your applications files to it and have your app work with them out of there. This is how most applications do this these days.\n`require(\"os\").homedir() + '/Documents/YourApp/';` is pretty standard for user documents specific to your application.\n`require(\"os\").homedir() + '/.yourapp/';` is pretty standard for configuration/core files used by your application.\nOr you can make AppData specific working directories for each OS but the top two should work just fine.\n\nThis is only meant for things you might wish to be tampered with. Anything not meant to be writable should just remain in your ASAR.\n\nAn advantage to using those is they are user profile specific. So your app will have access to them and likely not have permission issues.\n"
