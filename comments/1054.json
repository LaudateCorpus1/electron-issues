Kiosk mode doesn't block access to the dock or the menubar.\n\nI've had this same problem with running Chrome in kiosk mode directly from the command line. The only way I was able to fix it was to modify the Info.plist file in the Chrome.app with this new directive:\n\n```\n<key>LSUIPresentationMode</key>\n<integer>3</integer>\n```\n\nwhich is from the [Apple Launch Services documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/LaunchServicesKeys.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001431-108256).\n\nI'm not that familiar with the Electron structure, but maybe it's possible that the kiosk config option could conditionally added this directive in [Electron's Info.plist](https://github.com/atom/electron/blob/master/atom/renderer/resources/mac/Info.plist).\n"

    "body": "Did some investigation and found the issue to be related to [this SO post].(http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26694142/nsapplicationpresentationhidedock-has-no-effect) \n\nBasically, I built a version of electron that adds the code from the link to `windowDidEnterFullScreen`\n\nWhat I found is that I can prevent process switching, toolbar, yet I cannot completely disable the dock. For some reason, the dock is being set to`NSApplicationPresentationAutoHideMenuBar` rather than being disabled `NSApplicationPresentationHideMenuBar` no matter what I set the value to [as documented in the ADC](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSApplication_Class/#//apple_ref/c/econst/NSApplicationPresentationHideDock)\n\nIf someone can help out with this I will make it trigger around the kiosk option flag and submit a PR with the fix.\n"

    "body": "I am still seeing this problem with 0.36.2. If it matters, I'm still running Yosemite (OS X 10.10.5).\n\nI am running the Electron 0.36.2 prebuilt binary. To help demonstrate I forked the quick-start repo and only made two small changes: required 0.36.2 specifically, and enabled kiosk mode in the window call. The window call looks like:\n\n```\nmainWindow = new BrowserWindow({\n  width: 800,\n  height: 600,\n  kiosk: true,\n});\n```\n\nOnce I install and launch electron I can still get to the dock and the menu bar with no problem.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\n```\n$ git clone https://github.com/scimusmn/electron-kiosk-quick-start.git\n$ cd electron-kiosk-quick-start\n$ npm install && npm start\n```\n\nYou can still get to the OS X menu bar by mousing to the top of the screen.
