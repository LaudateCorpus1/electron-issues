    "body": "A blank window of Electron opens 36 unix socket files on my machine, while a blink window of chromium-browser opens 44 files.\n\nI think the answer is Chromium's multiple process architecture, an instance of Electron has at least 3 processes open, if the crash-reporter is used then there is 4, and they have to communicate with each other with IPC. Also the main process opens about 30 threads for various things like doing IO and watching networking configs, some of them may have a pool of handles for caching.\n\nAtom take a few more handles because it needs to watch your project's root for filesystem events, plus a few workers doing syntax highlighting, spell checking, etc.\n\nSo adding all of them up I think 36 is a reasonable number for Electron, and 56 is not that bad for Atom. And since Electron opens the same level of numbers of handles with Chromium, I think this is expected. You can probably go to http://crbug.com to report this to Chromium's issues tracker.\n"

    "body": "@paulcbetts is right. when I hit the maximum number, it stops me from creating any new windows at all--for anything. I get this repeated over and over again in my .xsession-errors until I close out a few things:\n\n```\nMaximum number of clients reached\nCan't open display.\n```\n\nI can see why this could be seen as a reasonable number. The question of whose bug it is may be reasonable, @zcbenz, this has been reported to Chromium's issue tracker a few times.\n\nHowever, Chromium seems to keep the number of sockets they have open under a bit better control than either Atom or Slack--I've seen Atom get a lot higher than 57. And, when I hit that max number, Chromium doesn't have a problem closing. Electron processes don't always close gracefully when that happens, which is why I'm not sure this is a purely Chromium problem.\n\nBut, again, I don't really know the internals all that well, so I could be wrong.\n"
