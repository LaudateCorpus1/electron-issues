    "body": "@RX14, you are correct. The issue is that **resize during move doesn't work**.\nI tried it on Windows 8.1 and noticed that during move (until you release the window), the size change is getting overridden. So you see it resizing to the new size and than it goes back to the old size which causes that flicker.\n\nAs a workaround I tried setting a timer to do the resize 100ms later and reset that timer when ever move is fired. It doesn't work reliably because while you hold the window frame or drag area without actually moving (no move event is fired), the issue still happens (the window is resized to the new size and then changes back to the old size).\n\nMy first hunch was that it might be caused by a patch we added a while back to fix incorrect size on window restore (the stuff we do with [`last_normal_size_`](https://github.com/atom/electron/blob/master/atom/browser/native_window_views_win.cc#L115-L160)), but it's unrelated (commenting out doesn't fix the issue).\n\n@zcbenz any thoughts?\n"
