    "body": "@davidcoleman007 Windows forces all other windows under a fullscreen window when it is initially shown, but if you make your window topmost after the fullscreen window is visible, it should end up on top of the fullscreen window, just like any other. I've done exactly this to overlay information on top of a live PowerPoint presentation. (If your window was already topmost, you may have to toggle it off and then on again to force yourself back to the top...)"
