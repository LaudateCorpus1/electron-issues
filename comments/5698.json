    "body": "Now that I dig further, the `availableFormats()` call already exposes a list of data types on the clipboard (as MIME type strings). And `read()` _looks_ like it takes a data type argument (although I haven't been able to make it work yet).\n\nSo this concept is already baked into the API. We just need a version of write() that supports it.\n"
