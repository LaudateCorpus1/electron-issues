    "body": "@daltonmenezes I believe you call this method\n\nhttps://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/api/app.md#appdisablehardwareacceleration\n\nFor @zcbenz \nI clicked when I saw the youtube video, this issue is reproducible on certain hardware on Linux distributions.  I've seen the issue before, it's been described as \"the app becomes a white screen and unresponsive\".  I think there is some kind of GPU error that causes the renderer process to crash.\n\nExample issues: \nMarshallOfSound/Google-Play-Music-Desktop-Player-UNOFFICIAL-/issues/885\nMarshallOfSound/Google-Play-Music-Desktop-Player-UNOFFICIAL-/issues/296  \n\nIt became such a common problem we had to write a [Wiki Entry](https://github.com/MarshallOfSound/Google-Play-Music-Desktop-Player-UNOFFICIAL-/wiki/FAQ#i-am-part-of-the-glorious-linux-master-race-and-it-doesnt-go-past-the-sign-in-screen) about it.\n\nIt appears to be isolated to crashing when a navigation occurs inside a WebView.  I.e. If you don't change pages it doesn't crash.\n\nIt appears to be REALLY hardware and GPU driver specific though.  It might help @daltonmenezes if you post your device specs and graphics driver version.  I'll add it to my data on this issue 😆 \n"
