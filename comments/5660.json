    "body": "You probably misunderstood the purpose of `titleBarStyle`, this flag is used to hide the titlebar but keep traffic lights. It was [a bug](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/3009) that the top of the window can be draggable when using `titleBarStyle`, it was never meant to be expected behavior. You can see it from all past complaints.\n\nThe reason we should keep current behavior is, this makes it possible to implement a window that has other elements in the titlebar, like Safari:\n\n![screen shot 2016-05-24 at 10 54 53 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/639601/15489822/fd588974-219d-11e6-8573-865420b074b5.png)\n\nHaving the top of window always draggable makes it impossible.\n\n> Besides, the behavior of hidden is also changed. Previously, there were no traffic lights. And that's what I understand the meaning of hidden. But now traffic lights turn up even if it's set to hidden.\n\nYou probably encountered a bug, `hidden` doesn't mean to hide the traffic lights, the difference between `hidden` and `hidden-inset` is the position of traffic lights.\n\nFor hiding the titlebar and traffic lights completely, the correct way is to use `frame: false` and do no set `titleBarStyle`.\n"
