    "body": "This is unfortunately expected behavior on Linux, because Chromium uses a zygote process to fork renderer processes instead of forking them directly in parent process.\n\nI tried to fix this by disabling zygote process (#1323), but it then produced more problems like #1605, so I have to bring it back (#2014).\n\nTo work around it you can probably read the env from `remote.process.env`.\n"
