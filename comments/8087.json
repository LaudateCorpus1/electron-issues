    "body": "Hi Kevin, setting height to greater then 16384 in the BrowserWindow constructor actually does not set the height to greater then the height of the height of a maximized window (height of screen minus bottom toolbar in windows). A second setSize or setContentSize is required to set it bigger up to 16384 at the moment. If it is larger then 16384 it will cause the window will go white and execution will stop working."
