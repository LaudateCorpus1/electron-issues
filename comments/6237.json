Is there some flag I'm not seeing?\n\nCanary of Chrome as of today doesn't have any new Async flags, just the one that's been around for a long time:\n![canary-chrome](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1845/16522120/a92d3860-3f69-11e6-9611-498ba4a43613.png)\nDo you know of some other flag/setting I should be using to improve Promises or regular Async stack traces?\n\nps. I did find out a way to programmatically set it by calling into the DevTools frontend code, but it's not pretty. I'm adding it to our internal Electron/Mocha tester, if it works consistently I'll likely wrap it up and add it to my [debugger](http://npmjs.org/debugger) module.\n"
