To me it looks like electron doesn't check if the current contents of the menu are the same as the contents it wants to set when handling `about-to-show` signal, and emits `layout-updated` even if there were no actual changes in the menu model, by deleting and re-populating the submenu children.\r\n\r\nSee testcase in https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/8455#issuecomment-279184217 — even that simple testcases causes the loop here.\r\n\r\nIf there would be any actual updates to the menu model at some point, `layout-updated` should be emitted, `about-to-show` will be triggered, but its handler shouldn't repopulate the submenu again and again for a single change that was already handled."
