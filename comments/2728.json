The last time my code worked in that stack trace is line 106 in player-core, which is:\n\n``` javascript\n        else if (blocker) { powerSaveBlocker.stop(blocker); blocker = null; }\n```\n\nAnd powersaveblocker is\n\n``` javascript\nvar powerSaveBlocker = remote.require(\"power-save-blocker\");\n```\n\nAnd it's not easy to reproduce because it doesn't happen often.\n\nIn any case, this is an issue related to Electron. Can you please think about what triggers it?\n"

Due to #1966 Node's message loop is still running when calling a remote method while waiting for browser process to response, the exception happened to occur when calling `powerSaveBlocker.start(\"prevent-display-sleep\")`.\n\nI suggest rechecking your code that use `net` or `http` module and catch all the errors in sockets and clients, it is very likely you didn't catch errors for a http request.\n\nI'm closing this because the error apparently came from the client side (because we didn't use `net` or `http` module in Electron's code) and we can really do nothing if there is no reproducible example.\n"
