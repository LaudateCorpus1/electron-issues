    "body": "This is related to #713. `apm rebuild` is unique in that it's useful even if you don't intend to use apm modules, since it relinks your native node modules to reference Atom Shell. It'd be cool if you could:\n1. Override the node dist to point somewhere else (i.e. so it doesn't download a `node.lib` built against `atom.lib`)\n2. Have instructions on how to create what gets pushed up there\n\nThe workaround in #713 should make doing this at least _possible_, but it effectively means I have to rewrite `apm rebuild` myself - certainly doable, but not something we should ask every atom-shell user to do\n"
