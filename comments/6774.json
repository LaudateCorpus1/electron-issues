    "body": "Let's think about your code for a second.  You are saying\n\n<pre>\nLoad a thing --> When we have loaded that thing --> Load a thing |\n                              ^----------------------------------|\n</pre>\n\nYou're event listener is always there, assuming you only want it to fire once you simply have to remove your listener when it fires.\n\n``` js\n  onload = () => {\n    const webview = document.getElementById('azure-login')\n    const loadPage = () => {\n      webview.loadURL('https://portal.office.com');\n      webview.removeEventListener('dom-ready', loadPage);\n    };\n    webview.addEventListener('dom-ready', loadPage)\n  }\n```\n\nIn future please ask questions like this in Slack or on the discussion forum.  The github issues section is for bugs.\n"
