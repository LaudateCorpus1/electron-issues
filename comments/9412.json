Instead of disabling the plugin I would recommend to stop intercepting pdf resource when this option is available, so that users can use `will-download` event. The option has to be respected [here](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/atom/browser/atom_resource_dispatcher_host_delegate.cc#L127)"
