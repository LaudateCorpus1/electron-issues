I'm using Electron 0.36.1, so the file protocol should be supported for service workers.\n\nI reduced the problem to the simple registration of an service worker and it still fails on my machine, even though it is fully covered by your test case. `sw.js` exists under this path (when i copy the path from the error to a browser instance the file is loaded). However this is not relevant for the error, it does not change if I remove the worker file.\n\n```\n// client/index.html\n<script>\nnavigator.serviceWorker.register('sw.js', {scope: './'})\n.then(function () {\n  console.log('sw registered')\n})\n.catch(function (error) {\n  console.log('error when registering sw', error)\n});\n</script>\n\n// client/sw.js\nself.addEventListener('fetch', function (event) {\n  console.log(event);\n});\n\n// main.js\napp.on('ready', () => {\n    mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({ width: 1200, height: 1000 });\n    mainWindow.loadURL(`file://${__dirname}/client/index.html`);\n});\n```\n\nOn the console I receive an error, that the registration failed. The network monitor shows a strange error, I guess the browser must have somehow blocked the request.\n\n![screen shot 2015-12-21 at 00 06 09](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/181198/11920736/2abb0b90-a777-11e5-8c6b-e5acb4acb77f.png)\n\nAny idea what could be different about my environment, that causes this behaviour? \n"
