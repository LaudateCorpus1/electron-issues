    "body": "Thanks for this, but I think the documentation of `preload` is detailed enough that this small example won't do much help for most people, so I'm closing this.\n\nAnd I do agree we should have more examples for the `preload` script, since there are many tricks and common practices on using it, and we could have a tutorial for it and link it in the documentations.\n"
