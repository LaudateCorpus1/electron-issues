    "body": "So it seems that when you click on a menu item (in any OSX application), it plays a little flashing animation, the menu disappears, and then the action takes place (thus the delay). It's something I never really noticed before. If you run the accelerator via the keyboard then the action executes immediately because there is no animation to display. I guess it's just an OSX quirk.\n"
