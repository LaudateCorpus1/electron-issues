    "body": "Hmm I can not see why it doesn't work with xvfb. Electron just uses Chromium for displaying the page and playing the video, so I suggest reporting this in [Chromium's issues list](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/list) instead, the Chrome team should have a better view of this. I'm closing this since we are not able to solve this on ELectron's side.\n"
