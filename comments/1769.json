    "body": "In case you are here with the same problem using `Webpack 2.x`, `React` and/or `Redux`, there is a chance that this would solve your problem:\r\n> Search your project directory for \"publicPath\" and change its value from `/` to `./`\r\n> with all the different available boilerplates this setting may be found in different locations, In my case using `redux-cli` which uses `redux-starter-kit`, it was in the `project.config.js`:\r\n``` javascript\r\npublicPath: './',\r\n```\r\nAlso if you are building for `Electron` you may need to add/modify the Webpack `target` property.\r\nStay Happy!! 😄 "
