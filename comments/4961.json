    "body": "@icode I got your query you mean to say is carry only the components of electron that are required to render a desired set of properties or attributes you want (e.g you don't want to use css 3d transforms so you will remove it from the renderer). \n\nIf you are considering it because of the size of the app bundle, removing a small pool of code won't make much of a difference anyway and secondly removing it might have breaking changes to your rendering.\n\nIf you still want to do so I suggest you follow the build instructions [here](difference) according to your platform and make a custom build of electron for your own use.\n\nHope this solves your problem :smiley: \n"
