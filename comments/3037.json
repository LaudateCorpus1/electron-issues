    "body": "So, my psychic debugger is saying that this won't happen on a clean machine, because this actually _isn't_ the initial launch, you're running it from two places:\n1. From your build location (i.e. a temp dir)\n2. From the installed directory\n\nThe good news is, this problem is fixed in the very latest versions of both Squirrel and Electron - have the latest of both and you should be :gem:. If you still see this in the very latest versions of both, please reopen!\n"
