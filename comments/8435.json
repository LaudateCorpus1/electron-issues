    "body": "Thanks @hokein for testing and reviewing. Have addressed the comments.\r\n\r\n> as discussed, would be really helpful to elaborate a few more details/steps about how electron renders PDF.\r\n\r\nUpdated the original PR description.\r\n\r\n> I find an issue about zoom-in/out. In the page which renders the PDF, press Ctrl + +/-, the web page (toolbar) will zoom in/out, but the PDF content doesn't get zoom in/out correspondingly, which is quite different with Chrome's behavior. In chrome, only the PDF gets zoom in/out, the toolbar keeps unchanged.\r\n\r\nYup this is because of our current zoom apis are tied to the render process and its difficult to manage state on browser process with it.  https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/8537 addresses this problem."

The way chrome does is, it embeds a browser plugin which loads the chrome extension. I am planning on going down that path in the next version of this renderer. "

    "body": "@zcbenz this is ready for review. The pdf renderer in iframe has a few issues.\r\n\r\n* `RenderFrameHostManager::UpdateStateForNavigation` returns early for subframe navigations to reuse the current render frame host which fails to trigger `RenderFrameHostManager::UpdatePendingWebUIOnCurrentFrameHost`. This will cause any navigation to pdf webui in subframe to emit `net::ERR_INVALID_URL`. This is addressed in https://codereview.chromium.org/2636193003 but will take some time for libcc to get this in.\r\n\r\n* WebUI pages are assumed to get their own render frame host with proper binding policy set from `content/public/common/bindings_policy.h`, even though we could set this on pending render frame host there are other places that assume the current render frame host has web ui at its root node and the ipc messages from the renderer aren't received because of it.\r\n\r\nBoth these problems can be solved by patching one liners across a few files which is not desirable for us, the better option is to wait for OOPIF support in Electron which will fix these concerns. Thoughts on having pdf renderer support in iframes delayed ?"

    "body": "@rreimann it was intentional not implementing the print feature, was outside the scope of this PR. It is definitely possible to implement as future improvements, if need arises. As to customizing the ui, its not planned to support as part of electron but you could always provide your own `pdf_viewer_resources.pak` file as long as it implements the webui apis. If you would like to block the functionality of save button, you can use the `will-download` event of session module, all downloads in electron will go through it."
