    "body": "This is because `dialog.showErrorBox` doesn't take a parent window parameter. Suppose your app have multiple windows it is impossible to know which window to center the dialog, and there are also types of apps that do not even have a main window.\n\nIf you want to center the dialog in a window, you should use `showMessageBox` and pass the window to it.\n"
