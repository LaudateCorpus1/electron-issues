But i would like you to know that I love Electron.\nI'll be translatlng all the api, and other files as fast as I can, tracking the updates and applying to their Turkish versions.\n\nAnother solution would be to provide references to their original Electron urls, therefore preventing them to lose their up-to-date state. This way, we would also provide access, to anyone that wants to read the originals.\n\nI'm trying to teach Electron in Turkey, and people need some Turkish materials. So I figured that the best solution would be to translate the api.\n\nIf you have some other solutions in mind, I would love to hear about it.\n"
