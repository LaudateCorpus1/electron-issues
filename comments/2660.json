[Gum Road](https://gumroad.com/) is a nice site to handle sales, but it's not a store, and you can't search it. So you still have to find ways to get your app in front of as many people as possible.\n\nThe nice thing about a store is that the people there are already looking for an app, so it increases your chance of getting installs being it free or paid.\n"
