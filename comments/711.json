    "body": "I don't have much to say that I haven't already (I do not randomly \"sudo\" things) but while continuing to build my atom-shell app's dependencies it seems clear that `apm` only works right from the windows \"cmd.exe\" shell (assuming node.js installed and [git added to PATH](http://blog.countableset.ch/2012/06/07/adding-git-to-windows-7-path/)). I have never been able to get it to work right from \"Git bash\" (msys running in windows shell AFAICT).\n\nThe following, done in cmd.exe (normal user privilege) is currently needed for me to have dependencies work on Windows:\n\n```\nrmdir node_modules\\node-hid\nnode_modules\\atom-package-manager\\bin\\apm install .\n```\n\nFirst remove any directory for the native module(s) that may already be `npm install`ed, otherwise it seems to see the stuff npm built and thinks it is ready and does nothing.\n\nThen do _not_ call the script in `node_modules\\.bin` (which on my machine is an apm.cmd file that tries to run /bin/bash or something)  but rather the original script. And of course, everything with backslashes, especially the executable itself.\n\nHope this helps if anybody else is having a hard time — I tend to use Git Bash for everything else but that seems to have been one of the biggest causes for all my build troubles.\n"
