    "body": "@zeke Thanks for the update. I recommend another approach however. It would seem to be much more easier to create a (commented) typescript definition file and generate JSON and other documentation artifacts from that. An similar situation is if you want both digital and analog copies of a video. If you start with analog you are likely to have great difficulty in producing a high quality digital copy. The typescript definition file (possibly with some comments if needed) is the digital equivalent. Another benefit of starting with the typescript version is that you can use it internally even if you do not do typescript yourself to feed IDE's (you will be amazed by the help that various IDEs can give based on a typescript definition file). You can also beta-test the typescript definition file as people can use it even if it is not finished. A JSON is not really useful in itself for most people.\n"

    "body": "> It would seem to be much more easier to create a (commented) typescript definition file and generate JSON and other documentation artifacts from that.\n\nI agree that would be a good starting point if Electron was a new project, but the content in `docs/api` is currently our source of truth about how all the APIs work. Maybe we can eventually move toward using a schema as the canonical thing, but for now it's the docs.\n\nThanks for sharing that `github-electron` typing. I have seen it and would definitely consider using it as a starting point.\n"

    "body": "@miniak @mmc41 Personally (although after some research DefinitelyTyped looks very useful) I don't think that anyone should have to learn a new syntax / style of documentation purely to document methods inside Electron.\n\nMarkdown is a global language that most if not all devs know the basics of.  I don't think we should be expecting devs to contribute to typescript definitions as our source of truth when an unknown proportion of them may have never come close to using typescript before.\n\nYou also have to take into account readability of the docs.  A typescript definition is all very nice but it doesn't fit very well with the way [electron.atom.io](https://github.com/electron/electron.atom.io) displays the docs.\n\nConsidering the current majority usage of the docs is to display easily readable content on either GitHub or the Jekyll Electron site.  I think we should proceed with @zeke 's cool doc parser and then potentially write a converter to take that JSON file and turn it into a definitely typed declaration file.\n\nThe alternative (switching our source of truth to typescript files) would require writing even more converters to allow the current usage of the docs to continue (typescript -> JSON, typescript -> markdown / jekyll, Etc.)\n"

It is out of date, inaccurate in lots of places and is missing documentation that is fixed / updated / added over time.  The entire purpose of the JSON api is to export the docs for an Electron version in a standard way.  Then the point of my `.d.ts` converter is to take the standard JSON file and convert to a definitely typed file.\n\nThen on release day we can generate a `.d.ts` file with no manual interaction that we can guarantee is correct as it is parsed directly from the documentation.\n"

    "body": "Hi @zeke  : This question might not sound right question to be asked in this thread, but  being starter on typescript and following this thread made me a bit confused.\r\nIn this thread we started to talk about JSON([#6408](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/6408)) and then [electron doc linter](https://github.com/electron/electron-docs-linter) and then typedefination, \r\nwhat I understood you will use JSON to make typedefination for electron and I am not sure about linter if we need that since typedefination will be used as a helper and provide intellisense, correct me if I am wrong.\r\nI need to use Electron's type definition in my project and it seems to me there are 3 versions of it available one which maintain by VS code, one by definatly typed and one which you guys are working on, which type definition is safe to work with? \r\nusually by running npm install we get typing folder but its not the case with following command, am I missing something? `npm install electron-typescript-definitions --save` \r\nThanks for you hard work and again sorry to ask this question here."
