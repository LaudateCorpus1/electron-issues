    "body": "It looks correct for the latest release, https://github.com/electron/electron/releases/download/v1.7.2/electron-api.json\r\n\r\nIt is marked as a `type: 'String'` with `collection: true`. This seems to be how other string arrays are represented in other Electron APIs.\r\n\r\nIt looks like other `String[]` APIs are also wrong in the `hxelectron` docs, https://github.com/fponticelli/hxelectron/blob/04d908d46be3e64758cbf9ea16bf9465b4b3ec1c/src/electron/Clipboard.hx#L45\r\n\r\nClosing this out since this seems like an `hxelectron` issue that should be reported there since it looks like it isn't parsing the `electron-api.json` file correctly."
