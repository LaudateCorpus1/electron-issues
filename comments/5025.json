    "body": "@feross Thanks, looks exactly what I'm looking for. I'll give it a try.\n\nIn any case, I think there is still an inconsistency here, since Linux obeys the `width`/`height` without considering the title bar, while the rest of the operating systems do the opposite, like if Linux had `useContentSize` enabled by default. Maybe there's something that can be done to polish this?\n"
