To keep the node-specific require. As this version is (in the browser-tread) only used for electron-specific functionality it seems to be a much better idea to rename this one than digg through all references of the browser-require and rename those.\n\n``` html\n<script>\nwindow.nodeRequire = require;\ndelete window.require;\ndelete window.exports;\ndelete window.module;\n</script>\n```\n\nI had plenty of troubles getting my require build process to run but electron integration turned out to be super easy and perfectly suported by the docs. \n@zcbenz I disagree: it works perfectly (no further plans needed ;).
