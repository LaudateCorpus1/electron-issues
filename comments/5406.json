Now\n- `Protocol` module can be initialized before the ready event.\n- `registerStandardSchemes` can only be used before `ready` event and other methods only after the `ready` event. \n\nA possible problem that might arise, is when making protocol module work with partitions. If we hook protocol as a property of session, then it can be used only after ready event which will conflict with `registerStandardSchemes`. So how are we going make protocol module respect sessions ?\n1. We could provide a `fromPartition` method and keep current behavior (or)\n2. Move the `registerStandardSchemes` api to `app` module and proide a behavior similar to https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/4551 .\n"
