    "body": "So I was able to yield the desired result by Spawning another electron app and thus creating an asyncdialog child process. \n\n```\nvar electronBin = app.getPath('exe')\nvar asyncdialog = require('child_process').spawn(electronBin,['forks/dialog']);\n\n...\n\nasyncdialog.stdout.on('data', (data) => {\n       //data contains list of selected files\n    console.log(\"from Dialog\",JSON.stringify(data.toString()));\n    //TODO: send filepath to render process to do stuff, e.g. transition with new video file\n});\nasyncdialog.stdin.write('openFileChooser')\n\n```\n\nAll dialog actions take place within that forks/dialog/dialog.js which gives my app that smooth dialog feel I want. \n\nThis works in dev...  However I am concerned how this can possibly work when packaged for distribution.\nSome tips would be helpful\n"

Exec is too \"seperate\", so **spawning is the best way to solve this problem**.\n\nI guess that's that Single-Threaded life :)\n"

You're likely thinking about the blocking stall when dialogs are opened browser/renderer side. \nI'm referring to the 1 second (or so) pause that happens even when you open dialogs in the main process. See below:\n\n```\nvar app = require(\"app\");\nvar dialog = require(\"dialog\");\nvar BrowserWindow = require(\"browser-window\");\nvar projector;\nvar dashboard;\napp.on(\"ready\", function () {\n    projector = new BrowserWindow({width: 400, height: 400});\n    projector.loadUrl(\"file://\" + __dirname + \"/screens/projector.html\");\n    dashboard = new BrowserWindow({width: 400, height: 400});\n    dashboard.loadUrl(\"file://\" + __dirname + \"/screens/dashboard.html\");\n    setTimeout(function () {\n        var parent = null;\n        console.log(\"showOpenDialog called\");\n        dialog.showOpenDialog(parent, {}, function (paths) {\n            console.log(\"callback\");\n        });\n\n        console.log(\"showOpenDialog returned\");\n    }, 3000);\n}); \n```\n\nAssuming either dashboard.html or projector.html had some animation or video playing, you would notice this pause. It shows UI 'processes' are not actually separate processes.\n"

    "body": "If you use the async version of the API that takes a callback, both Windows and OS X implementations are already using the async API provided by the system, which are the exactly same with the implementations of Chromium.\n- On Windows the file dialog is opened in a new thread, because there is no native async dialog API.\n- On OS X the `[NSAlert beginSheetModalForWindow:completionHandler:]` API is used, which runs the dialog asynchronously. It is not possible to run UI in other threads with Cocoa as far as I know.\n\nBut using async API doesn't mean there is no pause, creating a new thread or the native API itself would cost time. On my machine the `showOpenDialog` call costs 174ms, and 173ms of it was spent on the `NSOpenPanel` API itself, which can not be eliminated.\n\nRunning the dialog in another process is a interesting solution, because the pause time is only the time used for creating a new process. Under most cause it should be slower than calling the Cocoa APIs in current process, but on your machine it is not.\n\nAnyway I think we are already doing the best we can, if you have ideas on improving it, PRs are welcomed.\n"
