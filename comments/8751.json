Can you expand on the problem you're encountering?\r\n\r\nWe're following the dist-tags model that npm uses to distribute their CLI.\r\n\r\nYou should only end up with a beta release if you choose so, since `npm install` pulls from the `latest` tag by default. If you're experiencing other behaviors, we would consider that a bug and would like to hear about that."

The only way to make it predictable and reasonable is to not allow a tag that is also a valid version.\" I'd say that npm's approach is fundamentally wrong; versions are tags, and because they've introduced a cli that lets you mangle things further means it's not something you should base your releases on. this problem exists in npm only, not anything referencing package.json without implicit knowledge.\r\n\r\nQuote is from: https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/6846"

    "body": "I would second that pre-release/beta versions should have \"-beta\" or \"-rc$n\" on the version tag. You're right that `npm install` only pulls from the `latest` tag. However, I'm using `npm update` in my build process, and that command appears to pull from any tag:\r\n\r\n    $ npm --version\r\n    4.1.2\r\n\r\n    $ npm install --save-dev electron\r\n\r\n    > electron@1.6.7 postinstall /Users/nathan.thompson/Projects/tmp/electron-install-test/node_modules/electron\r\n    > node install.js\r\n\r\n    electron-install-test@1.0.0 /Users/nathan.thompson/Projects/tmp/electron-install-test\r\n    └── electron@1.6.7\r\n\r\n    npm WARN electron-install-test@1.0.0 No description\r\n    npm WARN electron-install-test@1.0.0 No repository field.\r\n\r\n    $ cat package.json | grep \"electron\"\r\n        \"electron\": \"^1.6.7\"\r\n\r\n    $ npm update\r\n\r\n    > electron@1.7.0 postinstall /Users/nathan.thompson/Projects/tmp/electron-install-test/node_modules/electron\r\n    > node install.js\r\n\r\n    electron-install-test@1.0.0 /Users/nathan.thompson/Projects/tmp/electron-install-test\r\n    └── electron@1.7.0\r\n\r\n    npm WARN electron-install-test@1.0.0 No description\r\n    npm WARN electron-install-test@1.0.0 No repository field.\r\n\r\nWhile `npm update` is happy to install from any npm tag, it _will_ adhere to the node-semver `satisfies` call. So if you used a prerelease tag on your version (i.e. `1.7.0-beta`) it [would not satisfy the caret range `^1.6.7`](https://github.com/npm/node-semver/tree/8fff3050401397e99aaf7a118015c0e33884c3f8#prerelease-tags), and `npm update` should ignore it."
