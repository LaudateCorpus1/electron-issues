    "body": "I think this can be solved in much the same way I solved talking from webview to my main app. I'm using socket.io to communicate from my app to my webview. I use the preload script in the webview to hook into what it needs and then I just fire socket.io messages back and forth from webview to app, app to webview. I don't turn on node-integration for my webview so it's isolated, just wanted to make sure that is clear. \n\nI don't see why you couldn't do something similar to what I am doing and create an event handler for the scroll events and then just manually propagate them to your main app using some communication mechanism such as socket.io.\n"
