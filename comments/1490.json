    "body": "@steelbrain The problem with IPC isn't the actual transport of it being slow, is that it tends to block up processes, especially sync IPC. If the renderer process is parked waiting on a browser process to respond, or browser is trying to send IPC to renderer but renderer is busy doing other stuff, you end up with hard-to-debug delays. The less IPC you can get away with, the better.\n"
