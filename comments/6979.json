    "body": "@hellonearthis rather than doing a wholesale copy of the REPL doc from Node.js, I think it would be better to have a short document (or section in an existing doc) that describes how to use Electron's REPL:\n\n---\n\nAssuming you have `electron` or `electron-prebuilt` installed as a local project dependency:\n\n``` sh\n./node_modules/.bin/electron --interactive\n```\n\nAssuming you have `electron` or `electron-prebuilt` installed globally:\n\n``` sh\nelectron --interactive\n```\n\nI think that's the main thing to cover, and we can link to the node docs for folks who want more detail.\n"
