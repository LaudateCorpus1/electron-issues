    "body": "@zcbenz played around a little bit and now I am facing some questions. I have a simple `out.js` file which does `console.log(\"Hello World\")` and my test case is to run `electron.exe out.js` while `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE` is set to `true`.\n\nI do NOT get the output on the command line (as outlined in this bug), but piping the output to another file shows that the output is indeed there, just not shown in the console.\n\nNow, when I add the following code after https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/atom/app/atom_main.cc#L61 I do see output:\n\n``` c\nbase::RouteStdioToConsole(false);\nstd::cout << \"cout works\";\nfprintf(stdout, \"fprintf works\");\n```\n\nThis indicates that the call to `base::RouteStdioToConsole(false)` seems work (because I do not see the output when not calling those lines).\n\nNow I wonder why node.js output does not end up in the console. It seems that any `console.log` from node.js is being rewritten to call `process.log` (from here: https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/lib/browser/init.js#L27) which in the end calls `std::cout << message << std::flush` in https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/atom/common/api/atom_bindings.cc#L83\n\nBut if that is true, why does the call to cout not end up in the console if it does when I manually add it in https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/atom/app/atom_main.cc#L61\n\nMaybe this is a flushing issue where the process terminates before the output is written to the console and thus it does not show up? However, changing my `out.js` script to `console.log` after a timeout of 1000ms also does not improve anything.\n\nAppreciate some more pointers what to look for 👍 \n\n**Update**\nUpon further investigation it seems that if `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE` is set to `true` the `console.log` methods are not patched but rather used as node.js provides them. In its basic form, `console.log` seems to translate to `process.stdout.write()`.\n\nIt seems to me that we need the same patching that happens for console.log calls for running inside Electron when running as node as long as we detect that a console is attached.\n"

    "body": "After spending more time on this I came to the conclusion that this issue is a problem with how node.js sets up `stdout` if running from Electron. When using `console.log` you are basically ending up calling`process.stdout.write`. `stdout`, `stdin` and `stderr` are being setup in [stdio.js](https://github.com/electron/node/blob/atom/lib/internal/process/stdio.js). There is code in place that checks for the kind of file descriptors of `stdout`, `stdin` and `stderr`:\n\n``` javascript\nswitch (tty_wrap.guessHandleType(fd)) {\n    case 'TTY':\n      const tty = require('tty');\n      stream = new tty.WriteStream(fd);\n      stream._type = 'tty';\n      break;\n\n    case 'FILE':\n      const fs = require('fs');\n      stream = new fs.SyncWriteStream(fd, { autoClose: false });\n      stream._type = 'fs';\n      break;\n\n    case 'PIPE':\n    case 'TCP':\n      const net = require('net');\n      stream = new net.Socket({\n        fd: fd,\n        readable: false,\n        writable: true\n      });\n      stream._type = 'pipe';\n      break;\n\n    default:\n      // Probably an error on in uv_guess_handle()\n      throw new Error('Implement me. Unknown stream file type!');\n  }\n```\n\nWhen running from the command line you want to end up in the `tty` case. However, running node via electron, I end up in the `default` case and thus you end up with a dummy stream that does not produce anything useful.\n\nMy theory is that because Electron is compiled as UI application, the file descriptors of `stdout`, `stdin` and `stderr` are invalid (or at least libuv is unable to validate them or detect their kind).\n\nI propose the following:\n- when we end up in the case where the file descriptors are unknown (and we are on windows), we use the same code we already use for Electron (in https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/lib/browser/init.js#L24) where all `console.log` ends up in `process.log` (which is a simple `cout << message << flush`).\n- we define `process.log` within `node_main.cc` similar to how its done in (https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/atom/common/api/atom_bindings.cc#L104)\n\nI was hoping for a simpler fix and maybe someone else has more ideas. The fix is a bit ugly because it adds a new global method to process when running with `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE` and it always just pipes output from stdout to `cout`, no matter what.\n"
