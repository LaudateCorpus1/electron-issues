    "body": "Was able to find a work around.\n\nIt seems if you add this CSS to your page:\n\n``` css\n@page {\n  size: 3in 5in;\n}\n```\n\nThen the CSS is able to change the page layout and `printToPDF` works as expected. Found a test case in [Blink](https://chromium.googlesource.com/experimental/chromium/blink/+/refs/heads/master/LayoutTests/printing/custom-page-size-style.html) using custom page sizes by the above method.\n"
