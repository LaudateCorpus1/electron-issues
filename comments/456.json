Inject some Javascript code into the page\n3. Have the page send back a message with results\n\nAt first glance, this would seem be possible in Atom today using a iframe with node-integration=disable and window.postMessage. However, many pages use the X-Frame-Options header to prevent being loaded in an iframe. So that means I have to load these pages in their own window. But with node integration disabled, I don't think there's any way for me to receive messages from that window, or listen for postMessage events.\n\nThoughts? Am I missing something?\n"

If there's going to be an iframe that acts like a self-contained window, I think the ideal solution would be the ability to embed a BrowserWindow or WebContents in a page, similar to the [webview tag in Chrome apps](https://developer.chrome.com/apps/tags/webview). Of course, that would still leave the problem of not being able to listen for postMessage events on the embedded WebContents.\n"
