At 10 seconds the src is changed to another website. The webview node context is reset? The preload script code is gone and IPC no longer works.\n\n**I just want to stress that version 0.23 works and IPC survives a webview src change. Versions of Electron 0.24 and newer all fail.**\n\nThe following issue may also be related: #1823\nAnother possible related issue: #1820\nAnd another one (dang!) #1754\n\nI am not using nodeintegration in my particular case. The interesting bit is that changing src is blowing things up. I'm looking into the code now to see if I can see anything that may have changed with webview.\n"

If not, after calling reload one time, it doesn't work. Even if you create a new webview, and initialize the src to any page of a website, it doesn't work after one time.\n\nSo, libchromiumcontent may not call AtomBrowserClient::AppendExtraCommandLineSwitches if in 'process-per-site' mode in some cases.
