If I add `process.crash()` to the worker process script I only got one error without stack:\n\n``` js\n[11724] Error: Window \"worker\" crashed: [object Object]\n    at WebContents.Window.nativeWin.webContents.on.event (C:\\Users\\nantas\\fireball-x\\CocosCreator_v1.js:209:15)\\lib\\main\\window\n    at emitOne (events.js:96:13)\n    at WebContents.emit (events.js:188:7)\n```\n\nAs for now I'm not quite sure where's the crash exactly. Manually added crash point in the problematic process script behaves quite differently from the actual random crash.\n`\n"
