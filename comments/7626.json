Try the [discussion forum instead](https://discuss.atom.io/c/electron).\n\nMy guess would be that browserify is overwriting `fs`, which makes sense because browserify is designed for the browser, not for node. I can't think of a reason why you would use browserify with Electron unless you have `nodeIntegration` turned off.\n"
