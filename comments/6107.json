    "body": "On Windows resizing a window relies on the existence of window frame, i.e. the `WS_THICKFRAME` style, and we can not set it for transparent window because the window frame would show under the transparent window.\n\nA possible way to is to capture the mouse events and implement the resizing from ground up.\n\nI'm closing this as won't fix since the behavior has been explicitly warned, and we don't have any plan on this.\n"
