    "body": "@gabrielstuff From looking at the code, it appears (to me anyway) that with how electron integrates chromium, it is not just a simple matter of \"passing through\" the flag.  Instead the flag functionality needs to be explicitly wired to the appropriate subcomponent, meaning extra work and code for features that may not have relevance or demand in electron.  I believe that may answer your question \"why the [entire] list [...] is not supported?\""

    "body": "hey @vossad01 thanks for the information. Do you have a link to a starting point. As per @kevinsawicki the thing is that it is a bit weird to run and try every flag and see if it has been implemented or not.\r\n\r\nFor instance, regarding this issue: https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/1277#issuecomment-296397800, ionphractal suggested to use: \r\n\r\n```\r\napp.commandLine.appendSwitch('enable-gpu-rasterization', 'true')\r\napp.commandLine.appendSwitch('enable-zero-copy', 'true')\r\napp.commandLine.appendSwitch('disable-software-rasterizer', 'true')\r\napp.commandLine.appendSwitch('enable-native-gpu-memory-buffers', 'true')\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut looking at the documentation, [here](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/api/chrome-command-line-switches.md) these flags are not supported. Who should we trust (except our test ðŸ”¢ )\r\n\r\nAlso, the disambiguation over `appendArgument` and `appendSwitch` is kind of hard. Reading https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/4908, it looks like appending arguments that could be switch.\r\n\r\nI'll be happy to help and clarify this."
