    "body": "@zcbenz , after I wrote a small example, I find that atom-shell v21.2 works correctly.\nBut this does occur on my project. So after some investigation, with some guess and luck,\nI am able to find out why. \n\nWe are using $stateProvider(ui.router) to do web page swapping on render side.\nAnd I use a temp default state, then it will transfer to a certain state according to user input.\nThis state changing is fairly quick. So it was running okay using v20.6.\nHere is how it looks like:\n\n$stateProvider\n  .state 'index',\n    url: '/'\n  views:\n      'main':\n        templateUrl: \"../shiftTemplate.html\"\n        controller: ['$state', '$q', '$location', ($state, $q, $location) ->\n          $state.transitionTo 'chat'\n        ]\n .state 'secondState',\n    url: '/secondState'\n  controller:[\n    ##do something, for example catching command\n   ]\n\nBut after updated to v21.2, somehow atom-shell's running speed is increased a little bit.\nMaybe it's caused by Chrome's update or nodejs's update, or you optimized some code in atom-shell. Due to this speed increasing, the command will be sent to this web page on render side\nwhile it's still in default state (called index here). This will lead to a command lost in the project.\nThat's how problem #1181 occurs. \n\nNow I remove this default state, It works fine now.\n\nIf later I really need default state, I will try to pass useful params to its next state.\n\n@zcbenz, now you can close this issue, as it's just a timing issue.\nJust keep in mind, maybe later this would come back to atom-shell in another form.\n\nThanks for your time using in this issue.\n"
