    "body": "On Windows only console programs can have stdin, but Electron is a GUI program.\n\nTo support this we have to either provide a build of Electron that is compiled as console program, like [what Node.js does](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/common.gypi#L150-L168), or you can work around this in your app by saving stdin into a file and then pass it to Electron.\n\nAdding a new build would put lots of burden on our maintenance, so unless there are strong requests to add it, we won't do that.\n"
