If you want to add it to your own app, it's pretty straightforward to get something simple running. \n\nFirst, wrap the very first JS file you run in this:\n\n``` coffee\n# Private: Forks to Squirrel in order to install or update our app shortcut on\n# the Desktop and in the Start Menu on Windows\n#\n# finish - A callback to be invoked on completion\n#\n# Returns Nothing\ninstallShortcuts = (finish) ->\n  target = path.basename(process.execPath)\n  updateDotExe = path.resolve path.dirname(process.execPath), '..', 'update.exe'\n  spawn(updateDotExe, ['--createShortcut', target]).on('exit', finish)\n\n# Private: Forks to Squirrel in order to remove our app shortcut on the Desktop\n# and in the Start Menu on Windows. Called on app uninstall.\n#\n# finish - A callback to be invoked on completion\n#\n# Returns Nothing\nuninstallShortcuts = (finish) ->\n  target = path.basename(process.execPath)\n  updateDotExe = path.resolve path.dirname(process.execPath), '..', 'update.exe'\n  spawn(updateDotExe, ['--removeShortcut', target]).on('exit', finish)\n\n# Private: When our app is installed, Squirrel (our app install/update framework)\n# invokes our executable with specific parameters, usually of the form\n# '--squirrel-$EVENT $VERSION' (i.e. '--squirrel-install 0.1.0'). This is our\n# chance to do custom install / uninstall actions. Once these events are handled,\n# we **must** exit imediately\n#\n# appStart - A callback to be invoked to start the application if there are no\n#            Squirrel events to handle.\n#\n# Returns Nothing\nhandleSquirrelEvents = (appStart) ->\n  options = process.argv[1..]\n  unless options and options.length >= 1\n    appStart()\n    return\n\n  m = options[0].match /--squirrel-([a-z]+)/\n  unless m and m[1]\n    appStart()\n    return\n\n  if m[1] is 'firstrun'\n    appStart()\n    return\n\n  app.on 'ready', ->\n    switch m[1]\n      when 'install' then installShortcuts app.quit\n      when 'updated' then installShortcuts app.quit\n      when 'uninstall' then uninstallShortcuts app.quit\n      when 'obsolete' then app.quit()\n```\n\nThen in the browser process once your app has started, do something like:\n\n``` coffee\n    # Background update to the latest version\n    rx.Observable.timer(0, 6*60*60*1000).subscribe ->\n      updateDotExe = path.resolve path.dirname(process.execPath), '..', 'update.exe'\n      return unless fs.existsSync(updateDotExe)\n\n      proc = spawn updateDotExe, ['--update', 'http://path/to/your/releases/folder']\n      proc.stdout.on 'data', (m) -> logger.info(\"Update: \" + m)\n      proc.stderr.on 'data', (m) -> logger.info(\"Update: \" + m)\n```\n\nhttps://github.com/Squirrel/Squirrel.Windows/tree/master/docs is a good place to get started with how Squirrel works. \n"

Also the cleanup does not happen, which means that after a few upgrades i end up with lots of squirrel temp files and old application versions. so if i can help to get a clean version of the updater into electron i'd be happy to help\n"
