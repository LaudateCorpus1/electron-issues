    "body": "@deepak1556 Wow, can't believe I didn't find that issue when searching.  But to answer the question\n- Basically there are two type of MDNS `npm` modules.\n  - The \"Native Module\" MDNS.  This requires `Bonjour` is installed on your users system which on Windows is a nightmare when using Squirrel.  So this is a no go for most Electron users\n  - The \"Full JS\" MDNS.  These are dodgily implemented and have a lot of flaws.  In particular they don't query other devices correctly on some networks.\n\nWhereas, the Chromium implementation is proven to work, and is proven to work ALONGSIDE an existing Bonjour install (this is critically important).\n\nDoes that answer your question?\n"
