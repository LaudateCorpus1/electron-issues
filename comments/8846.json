    "body": ">Have you tried to npm cache clean before npm install ?\r\n\r\nThis advice should address this issue. If `npm install` completes successfully after clearing the cache and you still get this error then this might be a webpack issue since it looks you might be packaging the `node_modules/electron/index.js` file which you do not want to do since the `require('electron')` is built into the app itself and `node_modules/electron/index.js` is for use when requiring electron from a node script, not an electron app itself.\r\n\r\nClosing this out."
