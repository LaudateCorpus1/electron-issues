    "body": "> Since Atom is based on Chromium, it would be beneficial to implement the Chromium task manager so that a user can see resource usage by package. Here is what Chromium's task manager looks like:\n\nI don't think this will get you what you want. Packages don't get their own Chromium processes, for Atom basically every high CPU bug will just say \"Main renderer\". Not particularly useful. A better plan would to be to monitor CPU usage and take a trace using the Content Tracing API, which can be done today\n"
