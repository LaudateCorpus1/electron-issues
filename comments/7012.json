Can you please explain what you see to be the Electron issue here?\n\nAs far as I can see this is just a webpack config issue so I'll close it out as such.  I would suggest asking for help on Slack or the Electron Discussion Forums as some people there will probably have used webpack before.\n\nOne thing I will say though is have you checked that the module is actually installed?  \n\n`Module build failed: Error: Couldn't find preset \"es2015\" relative to directory \"/Users/fuhuixiang/fdFlow_workspace/fuhuixiang/js\"`  definitely indicates that it is not installed.  Try checking your `node_modules` folder for the preset it wants.\n"
