    "body": "The V8 allows setting a wrapper for native class to provide extra information like how much memory the object has consumed, and both node and WebKit made use of it. However WebKit assumes only itself would make use of this feature (it's used for optimizing GC for DOM nodes), and node uses a very large ID for the wrapper, which makes V8 fill the wrapper list with many `NULL`s (the V8's underlying wrapper list works like C array), both issues contribute to the crash when taking heap snapshot.\n\nI chose to disable setting wrapper class in node, so we don't have to patch both WebKit and V8.\n"
