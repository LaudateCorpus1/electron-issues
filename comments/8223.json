    "body": "The http request job sets cookie header line after extra request headers are set https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/net/url_request/url_request_http_job.cc?l=324-325, hence overwrites with value from cookie store for that request context. We need to start the request with `LOAD_DO_NOT_SEND_COOKIES` flag to fix this."
