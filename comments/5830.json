    "body": "@zcbenz How complicated would it be to split electron.exe into `electron.exe` and `electron.dll`?\n\nWe are hitting the same problem with the firewall prompt, which is caused by the EXE path changing every time the application updates. If `electron.exe` and `electron.dll` were separate files, and all the resources and data files were resolved relative to `electron.dll`, we would be able to optionally put all the files into a subdirectory (redirecting the DLLs using an SXS manifest, like Chrome does it).\n\nThat would allow us to update the app while running, putting the new version side-by-side with the old one. The running `electron.exe` can be renamed to `electron.exe.old` and the new version put into the same folder with `electron.exe` name (again, exactly what Chrome is doing)\n"

    "body": "> That would allow us to update the app while running, putting the new version side-by-side with the old one. The running electron.exe can be renamed to electron.exe.old and the new version put into the same folder with electron.exe name (again, exactly what Chrome is doing)\n\nI don't think that this is possible, if an executable is running you definitely can't rename it. This also means that auto-updaters are now in the game of special-casing Electron (or at the very least, writing special code to copy electron.exe up a folder). You could do the \"spawn process that waits on its parent PID\" trick like Squirrel.Mac does (and Squirrel.Windows in some cases) though.\n\nWhile I agree that it would solve a bunch of small annoying cases on Windows (and believe me, I have been annoyed by these cases), I think it'd also be much more likely to cause failed installations because of the added complexity. Squirrel.Windows is already literally as dumb as I can _possibly_ make it, and it's still prone to failure (and every failure == a person stranded)\n\nI'm certainly willing to hear proposals on what we could do though, and the electron.exe/dll split wouldn't affect anyone in the short term (i.e. the existing Squirrel.Windows wouldn't care)\n"
