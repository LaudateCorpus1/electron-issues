    "body": "Yeah `ui::Accelerator::GetShortcutText` should be the right way to go. One problem is `ui::Accelerator` is designed to be used only in the main process, using it in renderer process it very likely to cause crashes (I didn't try though).\n\nOn the API itself, I think we can add an `i18n` module, with a simple method doing what you want:\n\n``` js\nrequire('electron').i18n.USShortcutToLocalizedShortcut(shortcut);\n```\n\nAnd in future we can fill it with more i18n/l10n methods.\n"

    "body": "@zcbenz Sorry for the noise, I have almost completed a PR for this (alexandrudima/electron@fa26312153761f98311582468310327505389987) but then I noticed that `ui::Accelerator::GetShortcutText` does what I hoped it does only on windows. [Under linux and mac it just falls back to the US standard layout](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/codesearch#chromium/src/ui/base/accelerators/accelerator.cc&q=GetShortcutText&sq=package:chromium&type=cs&l=220).\n\nI found a good method that would do what I wanted, but [it sits inside chromedriver](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/codesearch#chromium/src/chrome/test/chromedriver/keycode_text_conversion.h&sq=package:chromium&type=cs&l=21) and is not available when chromium is built.\n\nI extracted and improved their code and published a new npm module [native-keymap](https://www.npmjs.com/package/native-keymap) and adopted it in VSCode. It doesn't do anything yet for mac, I will tackle that when I get my hands on a mac, but it already works fine for windows and linux allowing me to render the keybindings better:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5047891/11594417/38f75d1e-9aaa-11e5-928d-98f6fc43bb08.png)\n"
