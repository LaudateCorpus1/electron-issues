    "body": "As far as I know, there are no ARM-compatible versions of io.js, but there is [NodeJS for ARM](http://elinux.org/Node.js_on_RPi). So if your app not consumes some platfom API-features, you can try to make a client-server web application and migrate to NodeJS. Of course, you will be forced to change a lot of things(for example, a way of working with JS contexts). On the other hand, you can consider an option to use a mini PC based on Intel Atom CPU, something like [MinnowBoard](http://www.technodisti.com/online-store/boards/minnowboard-max-single-core-detail.html). It will be more expensive than RPi, but it will allow you to keep your Electron-based application.\n"
