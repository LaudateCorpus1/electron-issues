This article, [Modern Login Items](http://martiancraft.com/blog/2015/01/login-items/), describes a way to achieve it but it requires an extra app (as well as your main app). \n\nIf you see https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/issues/756, I thought it might be possible if electron-builder were to give you the extra app* and Electron were to expose an API method to toggle the \"user preference.\"  \n\n\\*  Although maybe this extra app could even be provided by Electron itself? I don't know. It would have to be signed though.\n\n---\n\n@zeke no, see https://github.com/Teamwork/node-auto-launch/issues/43. I'm no expert though.\n"
