    "body": "0.32.0 upgraded Chrome version to 45, which is very likely the reason of the breakage. nw.js 0.12 is still using an quite old Chrome version, I think that's why it still works.\n\nIt is really hard to figure out why this is broken or how to fix it since I'm not familiar with Steam API, a good start is probably to investigate the changes between Chrome 44 and 45.\n\nI'm closing this since we don't have resources investigating this and there is no support on it. \n"
