    "body": "Looks like runas is failing to install. Can you try to install runas by itself and see if it fails?\n\n```\nnpm install -g runas\n```\n\nAre you by chance using the Visual Studio command prompt to run bootstrap? If not, could you try it? I know there are other methods for building on Windows but for me it's worked well across multiple systems when I've encountered various issues similar to this. I've noticed quite a lot of problems building node modules on Windows. It seems to be a source of much pain (at least it has been for me).\n"
