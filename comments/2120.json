    "body": "Sure but I would also like to mention this issue would never have been raised if it were better documented within Electron somewhere that when in the browser domain it is using NodeJS as its CommonJS handler, I have seen a few issues where people are a bit confused why things like jquery is not loading in global scope when it is loaded via a script tag, and I was confused wondering why `require` was available but it was not using require js or any other normal browser dependency resolver.\n\nSo I would request someone adds a section in the documents even if its just a short paragraph explaining that the browser script resolution uses nodejs so all modules are loaded as common js packages and its up to the user to add global instances if required, so its recommended to install browser dependencies through npm. I mean its clear Electron uses NodeJS but I assume most people will think like I do assuming it controls some backend bit which is what `remote` is for, and the browser acts as a normal non module loading environment normally.\n"
