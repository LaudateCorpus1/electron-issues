    "body": "What operating system are you talking about?\nAt least OS X and Windows have some guidelines where to store app data. So it makes sense to only have `getDataPath()` and no `setDataPath()` as this method will tell you where the operating system prefers to get data stored.\nOn OS X for example it's in the `Application Support/<App Name>` folder. Ask yourself if it's really necessary to break the guidelines. However, with the `fs` module you can store files wherever you want.\n"
