    "body": "> /cc @tarruda was this what you were seeing yesterday?\r\n\r\nYes, apparently it is a chrome issue related to gpu acceleration and video drivers used in OSX virtual machines. I tested and reproduced in all chrome versions between 53 and 58. I don't know why it only affects electron 1.6.0 which is based on chrome 56, maybe some extra chrome code that causes this issue was added in 1.6.0?\r\n\r\nThe workaround for this issue is to disable gpu acceleration with `--disable-gpu` or [`app.disableHardwareAcceleration`](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/api/app.md#appdisablehardwareacceleration). Unfortunately that's not a viable option in all situations, especially if your app uses webgl.\r\n\r\nI found a few chrome issues that seem related. Even though the rendering bug doesn't seem to be the same, all those bugs are fixed by disabling gpu acceleration.\r\n- https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=528349\r\n- https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=542873\r\n- https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=527556"
