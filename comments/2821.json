    "body": "The `Uh oh! Couldn't get i/o ports.` can mean 2 things, either there is no ports or the port open at the wrong steps/lifecycle.\n\nI tried on latest Electron and Google  chrome web browser with the same issue that tell me either V8 or W8.x have issue. I tried W7 early this year was fine. Note, I didn't have any firewalls or antivirus installed.\n\nYou can install any supported Virtual Midi e.g. LoopBe1, the output api from webmidi will show blank results, if we load the page, the device will appear. There is no race conditions from user end, I assume there might be a bug in V8 implementation.\n\nOn Friday, September 18, 2015, Cheng Zhao notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Which version of Electron are you using?
