Its a bug for being called twice, currently when cancel api is called we trigger `content::DownloadItem::Cancel` and `content::DownloadItem::Remove` which will both trigger `content::DownloadItem::OnDownloadItemUpdated` observer. We should the avoid the second call being emitted to the users.\r\n\r\n/cc @kevinsawicki "
