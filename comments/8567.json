It would be awesome to have electron respect the [`spellcheck`](http://caniuse.com/#search=spellcheck) attribute that Chromium already ships\r\n\r\nEdit: After coming across [this thread](https://discuss.atom.io/t/spellcheck-true/26669), looks like Chromium's core [\"content\" module](http://www.chromium.org/developers/content-module) ships without spellcheck, while Chrome implements spellcheck. I now see why Electron doesn't natively support this to date."
