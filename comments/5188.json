    "body": "@MarshallOfSound I did a quick test on Chrome (v49.0.2623.112) and Safari (v9.0.3) on OS X (10.11.3) and it looks like it is default behaviour. I think it has something to do with the fact that the command key the primary key for shortcuts on OS X. If you want to use the combination (command + a, or any other combination with command) in your OS X app you should use electrons [globalShortcut](http://electron.atom.io/docs/v0.37.6/api/global-shortcut/).\n\nI don't think electron should create a workaround because it looks like this is a browser standaard.\n\nI hope it clarifies things :)\n"
