    "body": "`bootstrap.py` succeeded in cmd.exe after i added the python, node, and git paths to the Environment Variables PATH preferences (apparently python doesn't pick up the PATH if you run `set PATH=...` in the console).\n\nHowever, update-external-binaries.py downloads an invalid directxsdk.zip file on windows. I can continue with the build by downloading and extracting these files into `external-binaries` by hand (using a browser to download, for example). Files downloaded by Chrome and script\\lib\\util.py's `download()` differ on disk. Separate issue?\n"
