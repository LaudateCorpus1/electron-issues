    "body": "`setFrame` and `setTitleBarStyle` have been discussed here #6413 and determined as being too difficult to achieve with any level of success.\n\nAs for `setTransparent` I believe this follows the same issue (too difficult to achieve correctly) as transparent windows are rendered differently to normal BrowserWindow's\n\nMonitor #6968 for a response there\n"
