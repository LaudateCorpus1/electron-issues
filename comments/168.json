I am not 100% clear on when/how often iframes are used within the main Atom UI, but I would think that wanting Node integration within an iframe is the exception rather than the rule. If so, could we have the default for iframe be `manual-enable-iframe` so that developers must explicitly specify their desire to execute privileged Node code from within an iframe (can we even come up with a use case for this?).\n"

Changing the line you mentioned does seem to remove the Node integration in an iframe (trivially validate by trying to access the `process` object).  But, I was still able to do: `window.parent.process.exit()`. So, it would be cool if we could figure out how/if it is possible to prevent cross-origin iframe navigation. We can possibly go down the path of the hack node-webkit used, but it would be neat if we could leverage the built-in `sandbox` stuff. But, in order for that to have any chance of working we need to figure out #193.\n"
