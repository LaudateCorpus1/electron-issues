    "body": "@kevinsawicki \r\nthanks for your response, sorry for my delayed working on a VSC Release.\r\n\r\nI took a look at the list you sent and then did a search which pulled up the following:\r\n\r\nhttps://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=98102\r\n\r\nYes Chrome does have some issues though they are slightly different but I'm sure related.\r\n\r\nwhen you access the hamburger menu then try to use \"Click <MenuItem>\" the item above\r\nthe one desired is selected. if you try to click a bookmark bar item you can see the mouse cursor\r\nmove up and to the left. \r\n\r\nthis behavior started I think somewhat less than a year ago. \r\n\r\nwith a basic electron app with the traditional menu bar in Windows, it is possible to select\r\nby voice the main menu items. However after selection and pop-up of the menu itself\r\nDragon slows to a crawl and cannot select any of the menu items yet it is possible\r\nto see the Dragon can \"see\" the menu item names as a debug log shows detection\r\nbut I cannot select them. Unfortunately Nuance has been unreachable.\r\n\r\nI was hoping there might be something at the electron menu level that would match what Dragon expects something I would be happy to try to help with. it seems since it half works\r\nthere might be something basic that can be done to rectify this.\r\n\r\nI am a voice only disabled user and would really hate to see electron apps inaccessible\r\nby users like myself. it's also cramping my work on VSC since I cannot access the menus normally\r\non the project work.\r\n\r\nThanks Christopher"
