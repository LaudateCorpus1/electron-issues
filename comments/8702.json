    "body": "@kevinsawicki about this becoming the default or not in 2.0, isn't this quite a breaking change for people that have code like this (pseudo):\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nmenu.popup(async: false);\r\nonMenuClosedCallback.fire(true); // <-- if async is true, this would fire directly, even though the menu was not dismissed\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe in VS Code for example need to know in certain cases when the menu was closed (which can happen not only when a menu item is picked but also when the user clicks somewhere else or hits escape) and as far as I know there is no event that we can use to find out. This is also the reason why at the moment we cannot really adopt the `async: true` option. \r\n\r\nI think what is missing compared to the `async: false` solution is a way to find out that the menu was closed (e.g. by passing in a callback to the popup function that is called).\r\n\r\nWouldn't it make sense to align the API here with how dialogs work and just make the popup call `async` if a callback is passed in and otherwise make it `sync`?"
