    "body": "We implemented this briefly in N1 using NodObjC, the node <=> objective-c bridge: https://github.com/nylas/N1/blob/master/src/browser/native-notification-manager.coffee. It's currently disabled because it caused intermittent crashing with Electron 0.29.2, but I think newer versions may be fine. (Registering delegates and preventing them from going away during Javascript garbage collection was a problem.)\n\nUntil recently, Electron's notifications were just the standard \"Web notifications\" from Chromium. I'm not sure if the recent changes to support Win10 mean they're handled in Electron now?\n"
