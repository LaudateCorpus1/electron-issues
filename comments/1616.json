So to answer your questions\n\n> Is it possible to create a completely new window for the video content and assign it a window level above the fullscreen browser window?\n\nnope not possible on electron side.\n\n> and also to only include the webview that contains the video?\n\nSince webview is the window bound for the contents inside it, if the webview got resized correctly to occupy the complete window then video element would have be resized correctly.\n"
