    "body": "It seems that the rpc calls block the code execution of angular, but not the render? If i run an rpc call at startup to say, create the menu, then the template will 1st be rendered un-compiled.\n\neg. require('remote').require('menu').buildFromTemplate(template)\n\nSo, does that call delay the code execution of angular, so that its compile pipeline is blocked. Therefore the un-compiled template is flashed? If i put other blocking code in there, then it works fine\n\neg: var c = 0;\nwhile(c<10000000){\n     c++;\n}\n"
