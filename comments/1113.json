    "body": "Since posting this I've come to understand that the io.js / node version is tied to the version of v8 used in the packaged version of chrome. io.js 1.1.0 uses v8 4.1.0.14, which roughly matches v8 4.1.0.14 in Chrome 41, which is still in beta. Seeing as how the author is undoubtedly aware of all this and it's part of the normal release cycle, I'm closing my issue.\n"
