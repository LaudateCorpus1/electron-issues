In your code you have `.success` and `.error` promised handlers anyway!\n\nIf your file dialog does not automatically open, you might want to open a separate issue - it should open whenever your BrowserWindow is about to download a file.\n"

Upon selecting a path, it will save to that location!\n\nRegarding the http request updates, in that case you might want to pick a different library that can handle this feature, but you should try to get this to work via Electron :)\n"
