There should be a `-DNOMINMAX` option on the command line (or in the `.rsp` file). Not sure why it's not in this case, because [it is specified](https://github.com/electron/brightray/blob/master/brightray.gypi#L158) in the `Common_Base` configuration in the `brightray.gypi` file.\r\n\r\n@CaiHuan have you made any modifications before issuing the build command?
