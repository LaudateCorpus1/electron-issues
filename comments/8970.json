Basically app.asar worked as a loader for another asar. But it felt hacky to me. I agree it makes sense to have an argument bypass the default behavior even if app.asar is present."

I.e. A single JS file which simply \"requires\" the .asar entrypoint that you want to use.\r\n\r\nClosing out as a duplicate, see the linked issue above for more discussion on the matter"
