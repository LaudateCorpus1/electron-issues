    "body": "> Does the global chrome configuration can affect electron.\n\nNope, Electron does not follow the content settings configuration of chrome.\n\n> Can this be something regarding a proxy\n\nCan't say for sure without logs, you could provide `log-net-log` trace. Also `loaded` event of process doesn't gurantee successful page load, the error is most likely caused by failure in page load which you can verify with `did-fail-load` event.\n\nClosing this out since its not a bug in Electron, can reopen if you think its a bug with reproducible example. \n"
