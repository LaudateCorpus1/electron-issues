Being new on Electron I'm wondering a few things if anyone could help ? \n- does electron need updating locally to include this new \"login\" event ? \n- how should i implement it ? Getting \"407 Proxy Authentication Required\" error after using app.commandLine.appendSwitch('proxy-server','http://...')\n- the \"login\" event doesn't seem to be triggering using the following : \n  \n   mainWindow.webContents.on('login', fcuntion(event, webContents, request, authInfo, callback) {\n     event.preventDefault();\n     mainWindow.webContents.executeJavaScript(\"alert('Proxy OK!')\");\n     callback('username', 'password');\n  });\n\nThanks for any help guys ;)\n"
