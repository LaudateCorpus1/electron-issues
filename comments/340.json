    "body": "@joerozek, I'm no expert on Mac Apps, but there are a few other places you have to rename things. Here is what I've done to rename it:\n\nYou will also have to edit your Info.plist file. It resides in MyAppName.app/Contents/Info.plist\nThe value you need to change is the `CFBundleName`. It should match your `MyAppName`.\n\nI also needed to rename another file in MyAppName.app/Contents/MacOS. It's named `Atom` and you should rename that file to the same thing as your `CFBundleName`.\n\nI haven't done much investigation as to why it has to be that way, but that's how I got it to work. If anybody else knows more or could explain a bit more, that would be great! I think some good documentation on this would definitely be a plus.\n"
