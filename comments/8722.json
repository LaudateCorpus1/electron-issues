Would you be willing to submit a pull request that adds this to the documentation?\r\n\r\nIf so, I think adding it to the [`webContents` doc](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/api/web-contents.md) would be best, as it is the [most-viewed API](https://cloudup.com/cDjARyBrWIc) that has a `setZoomFactor` method. It would also be good to link to it from the other APIs that offer a `setZoomFactor` method, such as [<webview> tag](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/api/webview-tag.md) and [webFrame](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/api/web-frame.md)."
