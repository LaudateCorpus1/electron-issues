    "body": "Yeah this API currently only checks for the shortcuts registered by this app and I agree we should make it system-wide, but I don't think it is possible for third party apps. OS X doesn't provide a public API to check whether a shortcut is registered, and the API registering shortcuts doesn't report error when a shortcut is taken by another application, I'm sure there is some private API to achieve this, but they are not documented anywhere.\n\nAlso for the example you provided, I think it is not checking for global shortcuts, it is just checking whether a shortcut is registered by a menu item used by the same application.\n\nI'm closing this as won't fix because it is technically unfixable, but if anyone finds out to do it, I'll reopen this issue.\n"

    "body": "Ok, thanks @zcbenz. I'll note for posterity that it does appear possible to make the shortcuts truly exclusive by passing [`kEventHotKeyExclusive`](https://gist.github.com/wearhere/de49aaebb8393de0955b#file-carbonevents-h-L15424) to `RegisterEventHotKey` whereas [we currently pass 0](https://github.com/atom/electron/blob/master/chromium_src/chrome/browser/extensions/global_shortcut_listener_mac.mm#L218), in which case `register` _would_ start returning `false`; but since this would be a breaking change in terms of the API's current behavior and we still wouldn't have a way to make `isRegistered` \"work\" maybe best to leave as is.\n"
