    "body": "For what it's worth, if you do something like `gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface scaling-factor 2` it _does_ have an effect on Atom. Unfortunately it appears that scaling-factor key is an int32 value in gsettings, so you can only get increments of 100%, and if your environment already has `Xft.dpi` set to an appropriate value for your display (via `.Xresources` or `.fonts.conf` or perhaps automatically by the X server), then some of Atom's UI elements will end up scaled twice.  The menus in particular are affected by this, and end up being gigantic with their contents overrunning the edges of the panels.\n\nI think Chromium is finally getting hidpi support straightened out on Linux as of version 43, so it may be worth taking another look at their implementation at some point.\n"

Through adding a flag to the command (usually start) in the package.json that for most is `electron ./` or `electron app/` for my case?\n3. or through [a chrome command line switch inserted programmatically](http://electron.atom.io/docs/v0.28.0/api/chrome-command-line-switches/)\n\n> Ship and load high DPI resources under Linux\n\nI'm having trouble understanding what this means.\n\n> Read system's high DPI settings and set atom-shell's DPI by --force-device-scale-factor=2\n\nSame 3 options as the first quoted line.\n"

I'm thinking that my laptop has a 3200x1800 and that I could do something like:\n\n``` js\nvar electronScreen = require('screen');\nvar webFrame = require('web-frame');\nvar size = electronScreen.getPrimaryDisplay().workAreaSize;\n\nfunction log2(number) {\n    return Math.log(number) / Math.log(2);\n}\n\nwebFrame.setZoomFactor(Math.floor(log2((size.width*size.height)/(800*600))));\n```\n\nx = zoom factor = floor( log_base_2( size / (800_600) ) )... or basically the lowest log_base_2 of how many 800_600 screens fit in the actual resolution.\nSo the app would be x1 on a 800x600 screen, x2 on a 1600x1200 screen... and for my high dpi screen size of 3200x1800, it would be x3? Yeah that works.\n"
