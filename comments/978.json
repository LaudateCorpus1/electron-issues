I've set `--touch-devices=X` to multiple different values and I see no difference in touch events being triggered in the browser.\n\n```\ngoogle-chrome --touch-events --touch-devices=8 www.google.com\n// Touch events work\n./atom --touch-events --touch-devices=8 app_path\n// touch events work\n./atom --touch-events --touch-devices=15 app_path\n//touch events work\n```\n\nPerhaps I misunderstand how this flag works but I interpret it as only the device id specified will be used for touch input. If chrome can't use the touch device does it fallback to finding it itself?\nI'm using this flag to try to resolve this chrome bug https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=439914\n"
