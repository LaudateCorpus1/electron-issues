    "body": "I discusses this in another issue somewhere RE a self signed certificate on a WebSocket, my idea (although unimplemented) was to use a custom protocol when communicating with the localhost API and respond to it with this.\n\nhttps://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/api/protocol.md#protocolregisterstringprotocolscheme-handler-completion\n\nSo you would request `localapi://localhost/rest/do/something` and handle it with\n\n``` js\nconst fs = require('fs');\nconst request = require('request');\n\nprotocol.registerStringProtocol('localapi', (req, callback) => {\n    request({\n        url: req.url,\n        method: req.method,\n        agentOptions: {\n            ca: fs.readFileSync(\"certs/ca.cert.pem\")\n        }\n    }, (err, resp, body) => {\n        callback(body);\n    });\n})\n```\n\nThis allows you to basically proxy the localhost API calls but the [`request`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request) module allows you to specify a certificate to allow in the HTTPS agent.\n\nNote: Unimplemented 😆  and I hope electron implements whitelisting as well 👍 \n"
