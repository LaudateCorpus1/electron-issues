    "body": "In case anyone else runs across this... this appears to be a GPU related problem.  Apparently Chromium doesn't kick in GPU 2d acceleration until you get over a 256x256 canvas size which explains why this bug only manifests with larger canvas sizes.  Disabling hardware acceleration seems to be an effective work around for now.  Use the app.disableHardwareAcceleration(); method before app is ready.\n"
