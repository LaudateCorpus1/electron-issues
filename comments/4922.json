    "body": "Thanks @zcbenz — I rebased because this had fallen behind and typecast `window.contentView` to an NSView via a local variable. I'm not sure why that compiled for me but not on the CI machine - wasn't able to reproduce it locally - so I'll wait for the CI build to complete and see what happens.\n\nI also started implementing this in N1 and I think that it may be more convenient to call `setSheetOffset` separately, rather than making it an option on `showSaveDialog`, `showOpenDialog`, etc... N1 has a few dozen places where dialogs, sheets, alerts, etc. are shown, and we'd need to make a global convenience method for fetching the appropriate offset to pass in. There are also some places where the dialog module is called within third-party plugins, and the developer could forget to pass a sheet offset. Making it a separate method allows us to set it from within our toolbar code and not need to worry about  saving it into global scope or referencing it elsewhere. What do you think?\n"
