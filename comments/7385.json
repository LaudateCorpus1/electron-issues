    "body": "I found [this document](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh779727). Assuming this, `short` seems to be used.\n\n> - Standard toast: Most developers should use the standard toast notification. This toast remains on the screen for seven seconds, playing a brief sound to alert the user when it appears. The standard toast is best for notifications such as an IM contact sign-in, or a social media update.\n> - Long-duration toast: This notification looks the same as a standard toast but stays on the screen for 25 seconds and optionally can play longer, looping audio. This type of toast is used in situations where you want to grab the user's attention because there is a human waiting on the other end of the connection. This is appropriate for person-to-person communication like instant messages and VOIP calls. This type of toast can also be used for calendar reminders.\n\nHowever, in some scenarios like chat clients, `long` would be helpful. So I'm glad if there is a set of notification API.\n\nJust for example, would the API look like below?\n\n``` js\n// considering only Toast notification\nconst {Toast} = require('electron');\nconst toast = new Toast({\n  text: '...',\n  image: 'file:///...',\n  duration: 'long',\n  ...\n});\ntoast.on('click', () => {\n  console.log('toast is clicked');\n});\ntoast.on('dismiss', () => {\n  console.log('toast is dismissed');\n});\n```\n"
