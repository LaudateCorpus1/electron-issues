    "body": "> I realize that this isn't exactly a normal browser, but it seems to me that it would be logical for the client to use browser versions of modules when they exist. \n\nYou're generally right though, while it's fine to use Electron's `require`, you generally want to use the DOM API if you've got it, since they often handle more edge cases than the node version (for example, if you use XHR instead of node's request module, you get proxy support for free instead of trying to do it yourself)\n"

    "body": "This little gotcha has cost me a good chunk of my time in the past week. `electron` ignoring the `browser` field creates some very surprising behavior.\n\n## [debug](https://github.com/visionmedia/debug)\n\n`debug` checks the `browser` field, and if not present will route all output to the terminal. Logging DOM elements or deeply nested objects becomes no longer practical, providing a worsened debugging experience.\n\n## [nets](https://github.com/maxogden/nets)\n\n`nets` checks the `browser` field to determine if it should use `xhr` or `request` (which share an api). In `electron` it will run `request`, leaving behind a blank network tab. This makes it impossible to share components between regular web apps and `electron` apps that rely on `nets`.\n\n---\n\nI'm sure there are many more modules affected by this both directly and indirectly. Would you consider respecting the `browser` field? I think there's much to gain and less to lose.\n"
