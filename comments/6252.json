    "body": "I debugged this a bit. The reason `'http://'` won't open using `openExternal` is due to the `NSURLWithGURL` call here:\n\nhttps://github.com/electron/electron/blob/4627311c34ec2ac636e54e8448b72d3d87344328/atom/common/platform_util_mac.mm#L133\n\nA bare URL scheme on it's own isn't valid according to GURL so that returns nil. That's probably expected validation for this particular API, but it might be nice to have an API that does allow opening other protocol handlers. For instance, typing `spotify://` into Chrome launches the app.\n"
