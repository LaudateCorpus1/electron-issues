    "body": "Ok this is weird for me. I got it. It worked, but after restart electron will load the added DevTools Extension never again :sob: ...\n\n```\nvar path = require('path');\nvar Theme = function() {\n    this.init();\n    return this;\n}\n\nTheme.prototype.init = function() {\n    var dir = path.join(__dirname, \"chrome-devtools-zerodarkmatrix-theme-master\",\"theme-extension\" );\n    require('remote').require('browser-window').addDevToolsExtension(dir);\n    debugger;\n};\n\n\nmodule.exports = Theme;\n```\n\nCan anybody point me to what I am doing wrong here? I have tried to close and re open dev tools to refresh contents. without success.\n"
