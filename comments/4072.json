    "body": "Hi, this doesn't seems to work for me with Electron 1.3.3 running on Mac OSx\n\n```\nElectron.dialog.showMessageBox([instance of BrowserWindow], {\n    type: 'none',\n    title: 'My Title',\n    buttons: ['Hello'],\n    defaultId: 0,\n    noLink: true\n}, function() { });\n```\n\nI get the `Buttons must be an array` error.\n\nIn the other hand, the only way to avoid that exception is to specify the type to other than `none`.\nBut that's not what I want. Since it will open my browser window _AND_ the native dialog, both at the same time (?). That seems a bug to me unless I'm missing something with the documentation or the way it's supposed to work.\n\nAn additional comment is that, the api is not consistent.\nThe way how I understand it, should be\n\nFirst, if you pass a BrowserWindow instance, the options are not relevant anymore, since the intention here is that the user wants to build up the dialog all by their own by subclassing Browser Window (Class, buttons, titles, window size, actions and such should be up to the developer).\n\nSecond, if it's something quick and you want to use the native styles like ('question', 'info' and all those presets) you can pass the options the way the API was already defined. All good with that.\n\nwith a simple check (pseudo code):\n\n```\nif(!([first_param] instanceof BrowserWindow) {\n  // use the BrowserWindow and don't validate the options\n} else if(isObject([first_param]){\n  // Use the presets and run validations agains the options \"thingy\" and trigger native dialogs they way how they work now.\n} else {\n   // maybe error or try different cases ?? Not sure\n}\n```\n\nAnyways, may I have some clarification how this suppose to work? Maybe this could help improve the docs for other people in the community.\n\nThanks in advance!\n"

(I had to go to the bottom of the page to figure it out).\n\nI have seen the discussion about supporting customization of dialogs [here](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/472), it's kinda of related to what I was looking for but it confirmed that we need to subclass from BrowserWindow to customize them.\n\nAlright, Thanks again!\n"
