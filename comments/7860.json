If you logged `getCurrentWindow().db.test().a` it would return the correct value.\n\nYou see `Getter/Setter` because properties sent between processes are cast to syncronous get and set functions.  If you want it to look as you expect simply log\n\n`Object.assign({}, getCurrentWindow().db.test())`\n"

    "body": "@MarshallOfSound Shouldn't there be an option to send results as simple 'JSON' object?\nI mean it's kind of big issue, i understand the fact that the object is that way because it is referenced both side. But in most case (like a simple math function), you absolutely don't need the result to be a remote object. And i am even worried about the fact that my \"result objects\" are referenced on both side.\n\nOne great feature (if not essential) would be to have a flag for `setGlobal` to only return \"non remote objects\".\n\nI think this is an issue/missing feature because there is no real way around this. \n"
