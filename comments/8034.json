    "body": "If you are running Node 7.1 on Windows you're likely seeing a widespread problem with the 7.1 release on Windows. You will not be able to install Electron and many other node modules because of this bug. There should be a new release tomorrow of Node to resolve the issue. In the interim you can downgrade Node to 7.0 or earlier release and you'll be able to npm install Electron.\r\n\r\nIf you go the route of downloading Electron manually from the release page here on Github then all you need is the win32-x64.zip file (eg. `electron-v1.4.7-win32-x64.zip`). If you download that you won't need to npm install Electron. You can simply unzip it and put your app in a folder called `app` that is located in the Electron folder under the resources folder.\r\n\r\nlike this: `electron-v1.4.7-win32-x64\\resources\\app`\r\n\r\nthe `app` folder is your app. Then you just use the Electron.exe to run your app."
