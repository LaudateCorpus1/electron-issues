    "body": "Just wanted to add a little to this ticket. I haven't looked to deep into Atom Shell's source code, but it should be noted that Chromium has publicly stated it will not be upgrading to GTK3; so the GTK used in the shell relates to gtk2/gtkrc. \n\nThe styles in the shell I assume come from Chromium, and are documented here: https://code.google.com/p/chromium/wiki/LinuxGtkThemeIntegration.\n\nI know there was interest in getting some of the newer Cocoa frames integrated into the shell, in regards to the OSX integration. Maybe it might be worth while to rewrite Chromium's c++ for pop-up frames? Port to gtk3 and newer cocoa (or it could just be a bunch of extra work)?\n\n---\n\n@mehcode Don't want to derail this issue ticket, but I'm using a modified Adwaita theme which I plan to release call \"Matte-GTK\". It requires 3.14 and uses the 3.16 wip gnome-shell.  You can grab where I am at with it now here: https://gist.github.com/nikolowry/9ffc10559cf2620c8d2e\n\nThe theme is Numix Circle with a custom Avocode icon I made. If you need that, it's here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B32HO0fHRql9czV5WFBncVNLSUk/view?usp=sharing.\n\nIf you have anymore questions find me on Google+ https://plus.google.com/+NikoLowry/posts.\n"
