    "body": "Currently `Atom Helper` is hard-coded, so the only way to change it is to rebuild with your own branding. I think we should probably search for `Helper` app instead of hard-coding the path when initializing.\n\nI'm merging this to #686.\n\n> Also, I noticed this commit in iojs: iojs/io.js@3d46fef (\"win,node-gyp: allow node.exe/iojs.exe to be renamed\"). Will this allow the .exe to be renamed without breaking native node modules?\n\nYeah.\n\n> Finally, in the documentation regarding renaming the .exe, it's not clear whether native node modules refers to core modules shipped with Node (e.g. tls) or third party modules which have native bindings?\n\nIt refers the third party modules with native bindings.\n"
