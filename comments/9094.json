    "body": "@tonyganch good test case! Here are the problems I can see:\r\n* I can avoid having a window open as tab when in fullscreen by using a different tab identifier but then this new window can never be grouped together as a consequence which seems weird\r\n* I can not force a new window to open in the same tab when I am not in fullscreen mode\r\n\r\nSo imho it boils down to having a way of telling a new window to open:\r\n* into an existing tabbing group\r\n* into a separate tabbing group\r\n* into a separate window\r\n\r\nI think todays API does not allow that."

I think that is what I was expecting for sierra tabs too."
