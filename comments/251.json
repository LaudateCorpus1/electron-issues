    "body": "I was trying to say that packing in terms off splitting runtime and resources is fine (e.g. external file with resources). Problem with packing is in terms of compressing (zip files, archives of any type). This is problematic because it requires some temporary directory to unpack to, and clean-up after app closes.\n\nIf that would be the case in future, events should not be changed I think, because there is no additional unpacking phase.\n"

Lightweight\n\n# **Candidates:**\n\n## 1. xar\n\nhttps://code.google.com/p/xar/\n\nVery ideal for our use cases but don't support Windows and require libxml\n\n## 2. cdb and its variants\n\nhttp://www.corpit.ru/mjt/tinycdb.html\nhttps://github.com/gstrauss/mcdb/\n\nDon't support Windows and file systems.\n\n## 3. duplicity\n\nhttp://duplicity.nongnu.org/index.html\n\nNo Windows support and relies on librsync, also targets for incremental backup.\n\n## 4. gzip/bzip2 compressed formats\n\nNo random access support, users have to read the whole file to build index first.\n\n## 5. zip archive\n\nLocating a file is not fast, symbol links are not supported.\n\n## 6. tarball\n\nNo random access support.\n\n## 7.

I'm not sure but I think it can speed-up app launch since it will actually access only one file.\n\nI'm not sure too but it definitely worths a try.\n\n> One possible problem is with installing/removing packages/themes. This will require partial updates of package and header, or if packaging is fast we can just recreate it each time.\n\nPackages are installed under `~/.atom/` so it is not a problem.\n"

(You would have to make a copy of your working dir for releases to not overwrite your \"original\" package.json; I would anyway suggest a release-dir).\n\nAbout encryption: since the encrypted file has to be decrypted on the user's machine, the key/password would also have to be on the users machine. So having this info even in an encrypted state would still be dangerous. So maybe stripping this info beforehand is the better solution.\n(Also your \"secret\" file could end up in the users temp dir ...)\n(**edit:** Also IMO this auth info doesn't belong on a users machine. Encrypted or not. You're never `npm install`ing on a user's machine anyway.)\n\n**Edit:** I'm not sure (never had private lib dependencies), but wouldn't ssh access to github with a key also solve your problem?

    "body": "As my comments on asar were referenced above - I'll qualify them by saying a few things\n\n1 - obfuscation/code-hiding is mostly pointless - if someone wants your code, they'll find a way to get it.  If this is a problem, you're using the wrong tools (CSS/HTML/JS) entirely.\n\n2 - runtime performance isn't a huge deal either - you shouldn't be storing a large amount of data inside a distribution archive, there are many, many better places to store data and code is generally small enough that read/write performance isn't an issue (and again, the tools aren't really \"performance\" focussed)??\n\n3 - whatever archive format you use should support dynamic read/write from the app itself so that the app can download/update it's own archive (auto-update) as slickly as possible(*)\n\n4 - it would help if it built on WIndows without a lot of dodgy dealing with age-old libraries ;0\n\n(*) for Node Webkit I built a thing which downloads GitHub releases and re-packs them as package.nw files (without needing to write anything to disk other than the final result - it's all streamed/piped in-memory)  The app then restarts itself and it's auto-updated!! - I'm not sure I could do that with an asar at this point?\n"

It is already mentioned that it is enough to prevent just average person messing with code. it is just handy, and you should not rely on that for security. 100% agree with you here.\n2. When somebody says asar gives performance increase, I think they refer to faster reads for large number of files, not faster read of one big resource. Though, I'm not I got it right. /cc @zcbenz \n3. As docs [states](https://github.com/atom/atom-shell/blob/master/docs/tutorial/application-packaging.md#archives-are-read-only), asar archives are indeed read-only, so yeah, for auto-update you have to re-create them yourself.\n4. not sure what you mean.\n\nI mostly agree with you, asar could be better, but hey, we need to start somewhere.\nPossibly related: https://github.com/atom/atom-shell/issues/673\n"

It can be smaller and easier to maintain, and add features incrementally. ATM `fs` module can be treated as `asar-fs` (with known limitations), and node's fs is `original-fs`. Maybe it is just me, but it seems weird.\n"
