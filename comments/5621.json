Like setting the `asar-unpack` option to a regular expression that will pick all those files and unpack them for you.\n\nIn my case I am working on an app that uses `PowerShell` scripts, which I found out do not run/execute when read from the asar archive, so I set my `'asar-unpac': '*.ps1'` and problem solved.\n\nAlso, you have to account for the path difference, if the file is not in the asar archive, it will be on the `asar.unpack` folder, however the **folder name has changed** in resent versions of electron.\n"
