    "body": "Hello again,\n\nI've discovered the problem. \nI leave here what was the problem for further reference for others that might cross the same problem.\n\nThe problem, as stated in documentation https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/api/tray.md\nis that:\n\n> On Linux in order for changes made to individual MenuItems to take effect, you have to call setContextMenu again. For example:\n> \n> ```\n> contextMenu.items[2].checked = false;\n> appIcon.setContextMenu(contextMenu);\n> ```\n\nSo the corrected code I wrote above should be modified to this:\n\n```\n mainWindow.on('minimize', function () {\n    if (appMenu.items[0].submenu.items[2].checked) { // appMenu Item 'Minimize To Tray'\n      contextMenu.items[0].checked = false; // contextMenu Item 'Show Window'\n      trayIcon.setContextMenu(contextMenu); // re set the contextMenu with changes made in the line above\n      mainWindow.hide();\n    }\n```\n\nMy problem trying to workaround this was that: I'm coding and testing in Linux, and until I found this, it got me changing the code to the point that is was also not working on both platforms (windows and linux), because at a certain point, it was bad coding.\n\nThanks for letting me know everything is working as expected.\nSorry for the trouble and thanks for the help.\n\nCheers,\nHugo\n"
