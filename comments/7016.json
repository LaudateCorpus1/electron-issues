    "body": "@rodryquintero React, Redux and a real time data store will solve your problem.\n\nThe issue as far as I can tell is that you are trying to make a real time app with a static data store (I.e. you can push into the store and then pull out), you want to push into the store and it to push it back out.\n\nAs far as I am aware RethinkDB does this for you.  It sends JSON to your connection when something inside the store updates.  Tapping this into redux will create the truly real time updating app you are looking for (I think).\n\nhttp://www.rethinkdb.com/\n\nBut yeah, questions like this should head into Slack or the Community\n"
