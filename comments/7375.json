    "body": "I ran into this as well, there seem to be a quite a few bugs related to the sizing of webviews when zoom factor/level are applied, all likely related.  The parent page seems to size the element correctly, but the content loaded by the webview is given an incorrect size to render in.  If its supposed to have 10% more space it seems to have 10% less instead - with the opposite true as well.  This seems to have been introduced in v1.2.4.  v1.2.3 correctly sizes the scaled webviews.\n\nVery apparent when you scale the page and give the webview a border with content source which scrolls in any (or both) directions.  Scrollbars will be nowhere near the border.\n"

I'm seeing it in 1.4.5 on macOS.\n\nFor anyone looking for a workaround, I've found that you can set the zoom on just the webview (e.g. `webview.setZoomFactor(1.1)`) but leave the zoom untouched in the parent renderer. If you have additional UI in the parent renderer and you want that zoomed as well, you can always use the CSS `zoom` property. Setting `zoom` on the body doesn't seem to affect the webview. \n"
