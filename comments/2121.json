    "body": "> if the default_download_path is set when should the file picker be prompted to select a new path ? \n\nI'm not sure I understand this question, most likely due to my limited knowledge about how this feature works. I assumed the the `default_download_path` is the path shown on the file picker when it is opened (in this case to save the download file).\n\n> would it better if the download manager remembers the last selected path and uses it instead of another path api ?\n\nI quite like that feature, but it would still show the \"per-user application data directory\" on first launch and would prefer to have an api call to manually set it to a different path or to have it set to a different default (user home folder perhaps?).\n\nMostly I suggest this to not expose to the user the inner working of the application, as a packed electron app user might not quite understand why the \"save file\" prompt would suggest a \"download\" folder in within their `%APPDATA%` ,   `~/.config`, or `~/Library/Application Support` directory.\n"
